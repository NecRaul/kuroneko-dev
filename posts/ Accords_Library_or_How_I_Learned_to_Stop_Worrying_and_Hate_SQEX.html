    <h3>Dawn of The Final Day - A Month Later</h3>
    <p>
      It has been a month since Accord's Library was shut down by Square Enix.
      To the uninitiated, the previous sentence might seem like some
      gobbledygook, so let me explain what each of those things are. Before that
      info dump, however, I have to do an info dump about my experience with
      Yoko Taro, Accord's Library, and Square Enix. Allow audio to play for a
      nice background music to accompany you while you read the rest of the blog
      post.
    </p>

    <h3>The Info Dump</h3>
    <p>
      I like Yoko Taro. I think his stories are pretty good. His games leave a
      lot to be desired when it comes to gameplay, but he knows how to write. At
      the very least, he knows how to write in a way that tugs on my
      heartstrings. His characters, in specific, connect with me in a level that
      few others might. Oh yeah, who is Yoko Taro? I forgot about that. He's a
      guy who makes games. He also has a cool mask of a character from one of
      his games. I was introduced to his works very late compared to a lot of
      others. I can't even say it was love at first sight since it took a lot
      for me to warm up to basically everything in the first game of his that I
      played. Regardless, by the end, I did enjoy it on some level. Enough to
      spend full price on his next game at launch, which is something I had
      never done before. Regardless, what ended up happening was when I consumed
      more and more of his works, there was still a part of me that ended up
      yearning for more. Which is how I came across Accord's Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accord's Library is (was) a site created by dedicated fans of Yoko Taro's
      work - translating, archiving, and preserving his massive library of
      materials. Unbeknownst to me, all of his franchises were massive regarding
      the amount of side content that was somewhat essential to the games. The
      original NieR release didn't even have the final ending in-game, you had
      to go get it elsewhere as an example. Accord's Library had a massive
      amount of this stuff collected in one place, making it easy to access. I'm
      not unfamiliar with chasing down stuff from the depths of the internet,
      but if everything I wanted to consume was accessible in one place, that
      makes my job all that easier. I loved Accord's Library for that. Yet, all
      of that would be taken away with such ease by Square Enix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Square Enix is a company of sorts. It used to be two different companies -
      Square and Enix. I was much more familiar with Square's line of work and
      didn't (still don't) have much interest in Enix's bigger titles.
      Regardless, both companions made supposedly good games. Eventually, they
      merged, and Square Enix was formed. In the process, the making of good
      games started to fade away. I can't say much about Square Enix anymore
      except I will not be supporting them anymore. I have bought many games
      from them, some of them very good. I was even planning on buying a monthly
      subscription to Final Fantasy XIV eventually - a game which I've heard has
      some decent writing of its own. I guess it will not happen, not in the
      foreseeable future anyway. Square Enix got in contact with the team
      running Accord's Library a little over a month ago - during October of
      this year, requesting certain materials to be removed from the website. As
      the amount of materials was very high in quantity, the team decided to
      shut down their operations fully, informing people of this decision in
      advance. I didn't want Accord's Library to shut down. Apparently, neither
      did a lot of other people.
    </p>

    <h3>Archiving Effort</h3>
    <p>
      Me and a number of individuals thought of this practice from SQEX fucking
      over fans as something not very nice. The Accord's Library staff clarified
      they wouldn't be providing the data, tools, etc. used to run the website -
      somewhat understandable as they were covering their own asses, but I
      didn't welcome those news open-armed either. The aforementioned me and a
      number of individuals didn't want this wonderful collection of resources
      to be lost to time, especially when it was gathered up like this, so we
      got to work on archiving. Over the two or so week period, we gathered as
      much of the data as possible. It was a very annoying process, I don't know
      about the others, but I had never taken part in such an operation before.
      I put my spaghetti coding skills to use, and now we have multiple copies,
      some of them modular, some of them not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly speaking, I was in awe of the scale when it came to Accord's
      Library. I had only ever used the main website and never took interest in
      the inner workings of the whole thing. I had made similar websites for
      work before, but I didn't have to know the whole inner workings there
      either, everyone was tasked with some part of the website. What put so
      much into perspective for me was going into their
      <strong>
        <a href="https://github.com/Accords-Library">Github page</a>
      </strong>
      and seeing the scale with my own eyes. Incidentally, this also happened in
      two stages: once when I saw how many repos there were, and a second time
      when I saw the picture of their architecture in one of their repos.

    <h3>Closing notes</h3>
    <p>
      I won't be providing any links to the archived materials right here, but
      it's out there. I know one guy from /tarog/ made a WARC archive. We had a
      guy from the archive Discord server who made a similar WACZ archive, and
      one person aside from me made an offline HTML copy of the websites. forgot
      to mention this prior, but I archived more than just the websites. I
      re-created the gallery website, which wasn't that difficult considering
      they were using
      <strong
        ><a href="https://github.com/rr-/szurubooru">Szurubooru</a></strong
      >
      - an open-source and easy-to-use image board engine for the gallery. All
      and all, we have these archived close to perfection:
