    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The Sekimeiya: Spun Glass (referred to as just Sekimeiya from this point
      onwards) was a VN gifted to me by a friend from /vg/ during Christmas.
      It's one of the very few OELVNs I've read and unbeknownst to me, it has
      quite the reputation. I started reading through it on January 1, 2024, and
      despite the fact that I had already finished it on January 14, there were
      still mysteries I couldn't really grasp, details I missed, etc., so I
      found it appropriate to replay it when I had more time to judge it
      accordingly. The VN itself encourages this as you unlock "tips" after
      finishing it for the first time, which gives more context to the scenes,
      highlights things you might have missed during your first read-through,
      etc. Along with this, although the true ending is explained pretty well
      after finishing the game, the same can't be said for some of the other
      endings.
    </p>

    <h3>Mystery and Time Travel</h3>
    <p>
      This is a mysteryge, and according to one of the posts I read after
      finishing the game, it's one of the best ones that have come out recently.
      However, the original poster also mentioned that this doesn't mean
      Sekimeiya is a good mysteryge, just that current mysteryges are bad. I
      haven't played many mysteryges, but I've consumed a lot of media that has
      time travel. Some of them good, some of them bad (mostly bad). So even
      though I'm unsure what exactly makes a mysteryge good, I know what makes a
      time travel story good: sticking to the rules set by the narrative. In my
      opinion, Sekimeiya does this well enough. Up until the last chapter (which
      explains a lot of the mechanics and mysteries), I never felt like the game
      was being unfair. There are a couple of eyebrow-raising things in this
      chapter and they become even more apparent in a later playthrough. It
      would be a spoiler to go into it, so I'll avoid doing that, but I felt
      like the game was playing by Jimmy Neutron rules at some points. This is
      all due to the fact that it tries to juggle many concepts utilized in time
      travel stories instead of sticking to a handful of them and utilizing them
      really well.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I liked, which many people (including the friend who gifted me
      the game), will probably dislike, is the requirement of prior knowledge
      when it comes to time travel "jargon" and a basic understanding of how
      some of the concepts work. Terms like causal time travel, loops (and
      infinite loops), bootstrap paradox, etc., are thrown around and although
      they are given a rather basic explanation, this explanation doesn't
      suffice. Now, this may be seen as the developers being inexperienced in
      writing (from what I understand, this was their first VN), which
      undoubtably is true in some instances, especially regarding characters and
      the game being too wordy (come on guys, this is an audio-visual medium,
      you don't have to write everything, we can see it on the screen), but I
      don't think the same applies in time travel jargon. Each time travel story
      will have different rules and explaining the rules of this one makes the
      story unfold (if you have good reading comprehension and can keep track of
      many things).
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, this doesn't make solving the mystery trivial. There were numerous
      times in my second playthrough where I had difficulties keeping track of
      characters' movements, intentions, and much more. I should also mention
      that the game has amazing features to help you solve the mysteries. Each
      scene has a brief summary; you can also take notes for each scene. Jumping
      to any line in the story and playing through that section is possible.
      There's a chart (you unlock after finishing the game) that I won't go into
      too much detail about, but it's essential to understanding the story. A
      map is also present, that's useful for one of the time travel mechanics.
      Using all these features, and information you gain from your initial
      playthrough (and additional notes you can get in your second playthrough),
      you are expected to solve the mystery. The game is rather ruthless in this
      aspect as some mysteries are hinted towards but never fully explained as
      the developers expect you to explain it in your own way. You have been
      given all these tools, right?
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoyed my time with Sekimeiya. It's not a VN without faults, but it is
      one that I'll keep remembering. In fact, I'll probably replay it in the
      future, which isn't something I do with most VNs. I'm looking forward to
      the developers' next project.
