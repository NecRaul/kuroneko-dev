    <h3>What even is note-taking?</h3>
    <p>
      Last week, When I was browsing /g/, I stumbled on a thread about taking
      notes. This wasn't the first time I had seen people discuss this issue
      (mostly on other websites like YouTube). When I happened upon such things,
      it always struck me as odd and obnoxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      My annoyance with them mainly comes from their names (and sometimes their
      length). With titles like "<em>Obsidian As A Second Brain</em>", "<em
        >Hack your brain with Obsidian</em
      >" or "<em
        >You're not stupid: How to learn difficult things with Obsidian</em
      >", it's pretty easy to judge who the audience for these videos (and the
      userbase of these apps) are: People who need to take notes to convince
      themselves that they are working/learning instead of actually doing action
      of working/learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I can respect someone documenting <em>actually</em> doing something.
      Here's one of my favorite
      <a href="https://sgt.hootr.club/molten-matter/urweb/" target="_blank"
        >blog posts</a
      >
      about a guy learning a functional (a paradigm I actively dislike)
      programming language I've never even heard of. But none of these
      note-taking freaks do anything other than procrastinating! Perfecting
      their "note-taking" setup to be just perfect. This is not exclusive to the
      note-taking people but, at the very least, when you spend time being a
      tinkertranny on something else, like your console emulator, shell,
      Vim/Emacs, DE/WM setup etc. you actually gain some productivity. You just
      need to be productive enough to offset the time spent being a
      tinkertranny.
    </p>

    <h3>
      How <strong><em>I</em></strong> take notes
    </h3>
    <p>
      For me, notes are used for very simple things. I had been using Google
      Keep to take/sync all my notes. It's on the of the few Google applications
      that I deliberately installed on my old phone, even when I bought a new
      one, I also did did the same. I was pretty happy with it, only problem
      being Google itself. It didn't have many features (like version control),
      but due to the fact it required no hassle to setup or sync, I was happy
      with it.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="postitem">Reminders (timed or otherwise)</li>
      <li class="postitem">Groceries (with checkboxes)</li>
      <li class="postitem">What I want to download when I have time</li>
      <li class="postitem">Very minute things like</li>
      <ul>
        <li class="postitem">Writing down usernames/emails</li>
        <li class="postitem">Writing something to show to someone</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However after, I lurked that note-taking thread on /g/ I mentioned
      earlier, an emotion of needing to debloat myself overtook me. Especially
      this post:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>$ echo "buy milk" >> notes.txt
$ cat notes.txt
</code></pre>
    <p>
      I needed a way to take plain text and markdown notes, without using
      proprietary software with convoluted things I will never use and sync it
      between my phone and my computer. The actual note-taking part was very
      easy to decide: Neovim. I would be lying if I said, I didn't look for a
      solution that contained both note-taking <em>and</em> syncing but in the
      end, I decided to trust my gut instinct by going with Neovim. When it came
      to syncing, ultimately I decided on Syncthing. It's OSS, it's very
      lightweight, it's written in Go - a language I happen to like, it has
      version control, it syncs automatically. It has everything I wanted. I
      wanted a good mobile experience too, but we can't have everything we want
      now, can we? In the end, I settled on Markor. It's a bit bloated for my
      use case, but I couldn't find anything that looked pleasant and worked at
      the same time.
