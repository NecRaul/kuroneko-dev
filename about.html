      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      I like the usual otaku stuff (anime, manga, light novels, visual novels,
      etc.), and I also code from time to time. All my money goes to buying
      physical Japanese media. My preferred programming languages are C, C#, and
      Python, but I dabble in others too. At the moment, I'm pursuing my
      master's, and hopefully, I'll attempt to get a doctorate in the near
      future. I also happen to have a slight disdain for people who don't share
      my ideas, as my ideas are undoubtedly the best ones there are.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this site, I will share my insane
      <em
        >(I personally believe they are totally normal, but people tend to
        disagree with me)</em
      >
      beliefs, media I consoomed, and left an impact on me
      <em>(good or bad)</em>, what I'm excited or disappointed about, etc.
      Basically, whenever I want to blogpost in a Taiwanese basket weaving
      forum, I will refrain from doing so and do it here instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's my
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@necraul" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
      channel. I share gameplay videos from various games I'm playing every once
      in a while. If I've shared a video from a game, I probably have a high
      opinion of the said game. My
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/NecRaul" target="_blank">backlog</a> of
      vidya is pretty big, so despite the fact that games that came out nowadays
      are a disappointment more often than not, I'll continue to eat good for a
      little while.
    </p>

    <p>
      And here's my
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/NecRaul" target="_blank">MAL</a>
      account. I don't particularly care which of the anime tracking platforms
      is the best. I had a MAL account a long time ago, but then I got banned,
      switched to using spreadsheets, and later made a MAL account to link to
      people who happen to be curious about what I watch. I don't rate anything.
