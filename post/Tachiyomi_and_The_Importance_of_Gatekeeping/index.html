    <h3>Tachiyomi</h3>
    <p>
      On January 5, 2024, MangaDex along with a couple of other extensions were
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240105233603/https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/commit/51f35d8d755b798b7430e3ca42185861ce842ef6"
        target="_blank"
        >removed</a
      >
      from the tachiyomi-extensions repository, as per a request by Kakao
      Entertainment. Coincidentally, this request came right before the anime
      adaptation of Solo Leveling started airing. A couple of days later, on
      January 9, an official
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240109001843/https://tachiyomi.org/news/2024-01-09-extensions-removal"
        target="_blank"
        >post</a
      >
      was made on the Tachiyomi website, explaining that extensions were purged
      from the repositories, and a way to add external extensions was added to
      the app. On January 13, another official
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240113193435/https://tachiyomi.org/news/2024-01-13-goodbye"
        target="_blank"
        >post</a
      >
      was made announcing the discontinuation of development of Tachiyomi.
      Following this, another announcement was made, announcing that some
      developers will fork the project, its issues, pull requests, etc., and
      continue developing Tachiyomi under the name <em>Mihon</em>. I wish the
      best for all the developers, but I don't have high hopes, as
      <em>arkon</em> - the main developer quit.
    </p>

    <h3>MangaSlop</h3>
    <p>
      I remember when MangaDex was having problems with its backend, getting
      DDOS'd very often and even had a data leak and eventually had to take down
      the site, until they revamped their systems. /a/utists wanted to make
      their own, new and improved manga hosting/reading site. Nothing aside from
      a bunch of potential logos, names, and front-end only applications came
      out of it. I even got a 3-day ban because I made one of the threads as
      people from the IRC were busy. Eventually, those threads were banned from
      /a/, people (and the threads) moved to /g/ where people didn't care as
      much, and development eventually came to a halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not a big fan of MangaDex. I think it works and provides a
      (technically) usable experience, but it has a horrible web UI, even worse
      mobile UI, and the content on the site is filled with slop. I don't mean
      slop in the way that most manga on the site is of low quality, I don't
      necessarily care about that, but unfortunately, over the years, just like
      other sites you can go to read manga, MangaDex has become dominated by
      Chinese and Korean comics. I'm sure you can find manga that has a
      different original language than those three too, but I digress. In other
      words, MangaDex, along with other manga sites, is dominated by slop!

    <h3>Gatekeeping</h3>

    />

    <p>
      Ordinarily, I wouldn't talk about tangentially related topics such as this
      in one post, but the solution for both is (or rather was) the same thing -
      gatekeeping. I didn't mention this, but the reason Tachiyomi had to stop
      its development was due to the attention-seeking behavior of a
      normalfriend. A twitter account I will not mention was providing guides on
      how to restore functionality of the extensions/how to add 3rd party to his
      fanbase of other normalfriends who are so tech illiterate they can't find
      easily available information via a simple search. Bottom line is, these
      normalfriends are also the people who are reading slop available on
      MangaDex and similar websites. Personally, I started using Tachiyomi when
      I was in high school (for reference, during this time,
      <em>arkon</em> wasn't the main developer - <em>inorichi</em> was). Back
      then, I was not a software developer, yet I was still smart enough to use
      Tachiyomi to read manga, set up an RSS feed for seasonal anime, etc. I was
      not a brainlet who needed people to spoonfeed me in order to get through
      life. Unfortunately, that's not most people and even though I'm not a big
      fan of private trackers and whatnot, these recent news has justified the
      existence of them in my eyes. The worst part is, there's nothing that can
      be done anymore.
