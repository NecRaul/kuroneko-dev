      closing notes section, I talked about what I've been doing and dedicated a
      large portion of it to my opinions on <em>Nukitashi 1</em>. At the time, I
      had only read <strong>the common route</strong> and three
      <strong>heroine routes</strong>, meaning the <em>Fumino route</em> or
      <strong>the grand route</strong> was still left. Since then, I have
      finished the grand route and therefore
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/v22899" target="_blank"
        >Nukitashi 1</a

      onto
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/v23741" target="_blank"
        >Nukitashi 2</a
      >, and a couple of days ago I finally finished that as well. In this blog
      post, I'll talk about both VNs, followed by the

    <p>
      I started reading <em>Nukitashi 1</em> in the last week of October, and
      now it's <strong>a whole new year</strong>! Sure, part of the reason for
      the blogpost being so late was renovations. There was also part of me that
      wanted to release the blogpost after the specials for the anime had come
      out, but I can't deny that I also procrastinated. I had decided on a
      structure for the blogpost a while ago, but I kept having trouble actually
      writing it. Oh well, at least it's done.
      <strong>New year, new me, new girlfriend, new blogpost</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Nukige</h3>
    <p>
      Going into Nukitashi, I was expecting it to be a
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/g214" target="_blank"
        >nukige</a
      >
      like many others I have read before: somewhat short, filled with H-scenes,
      light on plot, with a bit of slice-of-life on the side. Maybe my opinion
      was colored by the short anime adaptation, and I thought the VN would also
      be short, with the actual plot already covered in the anime and a bunch of
      H-scenes cut out. Needless to say, that is not what I got at all. What I
      found instead was quite a long VN if you, as I do, consider both VNs to be
      one story split into two parts. Let’s get the elephant in the room out of
      the way first: yes, there are more H-scenes in the VN than in the anime
      adaptation that introduced me to the series. However, the number of
      H-scenes is a pittance compared with both the overall length of the VN and
      some nukige that are a quarter the length of Nukitashi. I am not
      exaggerating when I say that reading Nukitashi for the H-scenes would not
      be much different from reading <em>Tsukihime</em> for the H-scenes.
      Although the H-scenes are written better than what
      <em>Nasu's</em> H-scenes, they are still not the main focus of the VN.
      Don't be holding your breath for an H-scene, because you'll be well into
      rigor mortis by the time you get to first one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to get into technicalities for a bit. In both VNs, I read routes
      in the order they appear on the scenario screen, and I think doing so is
      mostly the correct way to experience the story. In the case of
      <em>Nukitashi 1</em>, the routes get grander each time, with
      <em>Fumino's</em>
      route being the culmination of everything that came before it. However,
      when I read <em>Hinami's</em> route, I really liked it, and I liked the
      supporting <em>SS</em> character so much that I faced a dilemma about
      whether to drop the first VN in order to read her route in
      <em>Nukitashi 2</em> or continue. In the case of <em>Nukitashi 2</em>, the
      route order makes less sense, but that's due to
      <strong>epilogues</strong> for the first VN's <em>heroines</em> and
      <strong>DLC routes</strong>. I might have read
      <em>Nukitashi 2's</em> epilogue routes before reading
      <strong>Senzuripoint: Paccoman</strong> if I could do it over again, but
      alternatively doing so would spoil some jokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is somewhat of a complaint, albeit a minor one, but neither of these
      VNs is high-budget like some well-known VNs from well-established
      developers. There are even multiple meta jokes about the low budget within
      the VNs.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Low budget.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      When I was streaming the VN to my friends, they noticed the low budget
      immediately. The second VN has more meta jokes in general compared to the
      first one (or most VNs out there). Normally, I'm not a fan of meta jokes
      and self-referential humor, but it works well here. The other minor
      complaint I have is something that was also addressed in a meta sense
      within the story: some girls still love Jun outside of their own route,
      which made me very sad when I was reminded of this fact.
      <em>Nanase</em> is the prime example, and <em>Touka</em> and
      <em>Ikuko's</em> cases aren't much different. The developers changed the
      second VN so that all of the girls from <strong>NLNS</strong> have
      feelings for <em>Jun</em>, along with <em>Touka</em> and <em>Ikuko</em> in
      all routes.
    </p>

    <h3>Nukitashi 1</h3>
    <p>
      I have a tendency to make comparisons to other media when consuming
      something, and some of these might sound like jokes, but I'm sincere in
      what I say. The comparisons I kept drawing were to
      <em>The Matrix</em> (the first movie, anyway, I haven't seen the sequels),
      <em>1984 by George Orwell</em>, <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em>,
      and <em>the Rance games</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The Matrix</em> comparison is pretty straightforward. Jun is the
      chosen one, and even <em>Touka</em> and <em>Hitoura</em> comment on this.
      Along with that, they are fighting against an oppressive force in the form
      of the <strong>Pervert Law</strong>, with its enactors being the
      <strong>SS</strong> and <strong>SHO</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>1984</em> is a rather minor comparison. It has to do with most of the
      <em>SS</em> members we know and interact with being young, and with the
      women being the most bigoted adherents of the Pervert Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em> comparison is also a minor one. At
      some point, <em>Hitoura</em> basically tells <em>Jun</em> something that
      reads very much like what <em>Jetstream Sam</em> told <em>Raiden</em> in
      their first encounter.
    </p>

    <video class="postimage" controls>
      <source
        src="/videos/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/MGRR You Deny Your Weapon Its Purpose.webm"
        type="video/webm"
      />
    </video>

    <p>
      <em>Rance</em> comparison is less of a comparison and more of a contrast.
      <em>Jun</em> actively rejects power and domination, unlike <em>Rance</em>,
      and is usually the one being raped rather than doing the raping.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't have much to say about the common route, it does its job of
      setting up the story and not much else. Now, onto talking about the
      heroines and their accompanying routes.
    </p>

    <h3>Nanase</h3>

    <div class="duoimagecontainer">
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Nanase route_1.jpg"
      />
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Nanase route_2.jpg"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      One of my biggest complaints about <em>Nukitashi 1</em> is how
      <strong>Nanase's route</strong> is handled. Most of the relationship
      develops with meddling from <em>Asa</em> and little to no effort from
      <em>Jun</em> himself, there is a drought of intimate scenes until the very
      end of the route, the childhood friend aspect is much the same, not
      utilized until the last quarter of the route. I don't know if this is
      accurate, but it certainly feels like the majority of the H-scenes in
      <em>Nanase's</em> route happen with girls from <em>SS</em> and
      <em>SHO</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extra scenario you unlock after beating the route comes out of left
      field, unlike the extra scenarios from the other two routes. Even the
      anime handles <em>Nanase's</em> "route" better, but we'll get to that
      later in the blogpost. This is my emotions speaking, as the reason for
      this will become more apparent later in the blogpost but the
      <em>Nanase</em> route is also a route I can't ever go back to because it
      essentially acts like a <strong>bad ending</strong> when looked at through
      the lens of the grand route.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Nanase</em> is <strong>my favorite NLNS heroine</strong>, so her route
      being the worst of the bunch was a massive disappointment. The last thing
      I'll complain about here isn't her route, but the fact that in all routes
      in both VNs, she has feelings for <em>Jun</em>. This made it very hard for
      me to contextualize in a way that did not diminish my enjoyment,
      especially when I didn't want her to suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm pretty sure it's some sort of inside joke that she is the most popular
      heroine among fans, yet she has the worst route and is the eternal loser.
      If it wasn't the case during the development of the first VN, it certainly
      was for the second VN. Jokes at her expense are abundant in the second VN.
      I found them somewhat funny, but they also made me feel bad.
    </p>

    <h3>Hinami</h3>

    <div class="duoimagecontainer">
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Hinami route_1.jpg"
      />
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Hinami route_2.jpg"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Hinami's route</strong>, in comparison, was great for a multitude
      of reasons. I like lolis, so I was gravitating toward her at the start of
      the VN, but <em>Nanase</em> won me over. It's the first look into how
      <em>SS</em> operates, the internal dilemma from <em>Jun</em>, information
      about major plot points that will become relevant in other routes, as well
      as introducing <em>Rei</em>, whom I'll talk about more extensively later
      in the blogpost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Hinami</em> herself is great in her own right. I know her being a loli
      but also a senpai is played as a joke, but in the few moments when it is
      played straight, it is very sweet. I was taking screenshots throughout the
      VN whenever something funny, important, or erotic happened, and her route
      ended up being the one with the most screenshots in <em>Nukitashi 1</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Misaki</h3>

    <div class="duoimagecontainer">
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Misaki route_1.jpg"
      />
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Misaki route_2.jpg"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      I don't share <em>Jun's</em> sentiment regarding <em>Misaki</em>. It's not
      that I dislike her, but unlike <em>Jun</em>, I wasn't interested in her
      from the start. <strong>Misaki's route</strong> ended up being somewhat of
      a bore to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was somewhat weird that <em>Jun's</em> positive feelings toward
      <em>Misaki</em>, which were apparent even in the common route, make her
      route the one that progresses the fastest and the most. Not even the grand
      route has <em>Jun</em> being so in love and obsessed with
      <em>Fumino</em> by the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, the best parts of the <em>Misaki</em> route were the later scenes
      with <em>Ikuko</em>. I felt somewhat negative toward <em>Ikuko</em> after
      the common route, but she became endearing by the end of
      <em>Misaki's</em> route.
    </p>

    <h3>Fumino</h3>

    <div class="duoimagecontainer">
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Fumino route_1.jpg"
      />
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Fumino route_2.jpg"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Fumino's route</strong>, or <strong>the grand route</strong>, was
      alright. I like
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/i648" target="_blank"
        >yamato nadeshikos</a
      >
      to a degree, but I wish her personality was richer instead of just her
      being a <em>dog</em> and a <em>yamato nadeshiko</em>. <em>Fumino</em> is
      younger compared to the rest of the cast, so her developing fetishes from
      new sexual experiences was pretty funny (and hot).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this route, everything gets resolved, albeit I still wanted more
      resolution to the situation with <em>Nanase</em> at the end. I found the
      constantly teased and easily predictable plot point of her mom being the
      one from <em>Jun's</em> past kind of meh.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I didn't like was making <em>Sakimori</em> so villainous when,
      in comparison, they made <em>Hitoura</em> somewhat relatable. It's as if
      they ran out of humanity to put in these characters. Making
      <em>Sakimori</em> obsessed with getting revenge for his daughter while
      completely ignoring the fruit of her daughter's love was weird.
    </p>

    <h3>Nukitashi 2</h3>
    <p>
      While the first VN is decent and has good heroines,
      <em>Nukitashi 2</em> is on a level of its own in almost every category.
      For one thing, it has more ups and downs, which can be a good or a bad
      thing depending on your perspective. As a matter of fact, while I think
      <em>Nukitashi 2</em> is funnier than the first VN, it also has more jokes,
      which means it also has more bad jokes compared to the first VN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having <strong>the common route</strong> intertwined with the
      <strong>heroine routes</strong> has its advantages and disadvantages. For
      one, it makes reading the first route way more enjoyable, as you get to
      spend time not only with the heroine you're pursuing but also with the
      other <em>SS</em> members, who are fun characters in their own right. As a
      downside, however, on subsequent routes, you have a lot of things you'll
      have to re-read or skip. Re-reading is one thing, but when you skip and
      get to a new heroine-specific scene, you have to backtrack to see where in
      the story you are.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Fight scene.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      This VN is supposed to pick up after the <em>Fumino route</em> of the
      first VN, but they hand-wave away <em>Jun and Fumino's relationship</em>.
      Essentially, <em>Jun</em> didn't have sex with any of the heroines, except
      for being raped by <em>SS</em> and <em>SHO</em> girls, the last one being
      <em>Ikuko</em> toward the end of the common route. Instead, everyone from
      NLNS is in love with <em>Jun</em>, along with two-thirds of the
      <strong>SS Big Three</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Going back to comparisons to other media, I'd like to mention
      <em>Matrix</em> and <em>Rance</em> again. In the alternate world of
      <em>Nukitashi 2</em>, <em>Jun</em> begrudgingly has accepted his role as
      the chosen one, becoming <strong>Seitei</strong> in order to keep
      <em>Asane</em> safe. Just like <em>Rance</em>, he has become active,
      dominant, and accepting of power. <em>Jun</em> even rapes the villain!
    </p>
    <p>
      In comparison to the first VN's villains, <em>Mizukihi</em> and
      <em>Rin</em> are weak characters. Even the straight-up comedically evil
      <em>Sakimori</em> gets redeemed, but <em>Mizukihi's</em> motivations and
      actions are so nonsensical that they left me exasperated. Everything with
      <em>Rin</em> is just her wanting more power in a bureaucratic system, and
      it's played as a joke for the most part. Part of the villains being so
      weak probably has to do with <em>Nukitashi 1's</em> villains being much
      stronger in terms of writing: <em>the SS</em>, <em>Hitoura</em>, and
      <em>Sakimori</em>. Making the <em>SS</em> your allies and the
      <em>NLNS</em> members less of an adversary and more of a hurdle to get
      through until they become your allies again left the VN with no compelling
      villains. The first VN's last fight also had more stakes, and I could
      suspend my disbelief over <strong>Homo Erectus</strong>, while I couldn't
      do the same for <em>Jun</em> being a <strong>cum Spider-Man</strong>.
      Lastly, the <em>Mizukihi</em> extra scenario at the end of the common
      route was underwhelming, nothing to write home about.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have less to say about the heroines of <em>Nukitashi 2</em>. Not because
      I like them less than the <em>NLNS</em> heroines, but because it feels
      like you spend so much more time with them, and you should read the VN to
      see for yourself.
    </p>

    <h3>Touka</h3>

    <div class="duoimagecontainer">
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Touka route_1.jpg"
      />
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Touka route_2.jpg"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      I think she is a bundle of joy and very hot.
      <strong>Touka's route</strong> was fun, and her ending is definitely up
      there for me. However, I couldn't really put myself in
      <em>Jun's</em> shoes toward the end of her route.
    </p>
    <p>
      First and foremost, the time skip was expected, but they should have
      explained the consequences of the pregnancy more. Secondly, I think part
      of her character suffers from shackles put on her by the extra chapter in
      <em>Nukitashi 1's</em> <em>Nanase</em> route. I think her being unable to
      do basic tasks is due to what was said in that extra chapter, which limits
      her character quite a bit. Simply put, it was a joke that limited her
      character, and I don't buy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, although I love her a lot, she's a terrible depiction of autism.
      With the exception of <strong>Mayuri</strong> from
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/v2002" target="_blank"
        >Steins;Gate</a
      >, autism has never been depicted properly in weeaboo mediums, so that's
      nothing new.
    </p>

    <h3>Rei</h3>

    <div class="duoimagecontainer">
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Rei route_1.jpg"
      />
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Rei route_2.jpg"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      When I mentioned that I liked one of the side characters so much that I
      wanted to put the first VN on hold to read <em>Nukitashi 2</em>, I was
      talking about <em>Rei</em>. What is there to not like about her really? I
      had never heard of the term "route hijacker" before, but it fits perfectly
      with her considering I loved her in <em>Hinami's</em> route.
      <strong>Rei's route</strong> is simply bordering on perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Nanase</em> has been a great wing-woman and both the MVP of the story
      and my heart, she shines in this route once again, specifically during the
      last event. I will not spoil it, as it is written and voice acted
      remarkably well. I could see it coming a mile away, hear
      <em>Nanase's</em> voice start to change, yet my throat still felt like
      there was a knot in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the romance and H-scenes with <em>Rei</em> are also great. It also
      ends on a realistic note. It is not just sunshine and happiness for these
      two characters. They still have their issues, which they will have to work
      out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of down-to-earth ending would normally make me happy, but I
      wished for a more joyful conclusion. I am that much of a waifufag for
      <em>Rei</em>. The other two <em>SS</em> heroines get their happy endings,
      complete with time skips and pregnancies. What about my darling
      <em>Rei</em>?
    </p>

    <h3>Ikuko</h3>

    <div class="duoimagecontainer">
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Ikuko route_1.jpg"
      />
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Ikuko route_2.jpg"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      <em>Ikuko</em> wasn't a very interesting character in the first VN. She
      was hot, but that was about it. Sadly, her character hasn't been improved
      upon that much here.
    </p>
    <p>
      That isn't to say I don't like <strong>Ikuko's route</strong>. I had a
      sort of hate-boner for her in the first VN, and I think most people did as
      well. I don't have an aversion to rape, but I wish her character had been
      explored a bit more before the rape. Oh well, crazy in the head, crazy in
      the bed, as they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      That influenced the development of her character, route, H-scenes, and how
      her route is concluded. I just think they should have made her an actual
      character. Her backstory is similar to that of <em>Bridget</em> from
      Guilty Gear before, you know, before they made <em>Bridget</em> a tranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't have much to say about <em>Ikuko's</em> route aside from that.
      It's fun and hot, gets ridiculous toward the end, but overall it is not
      very interesting.
    </p>

    <h3>Susuko</h3>

    <div class="duoimagecontainer">
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Susuko route_1.jpg"
      />
      <img
        class="duoimage zoomimage"
        src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Susuko route_2.jpg"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Susuko's route</strong> was a breath of fresh air after reading
      through two very boring epilogues. There is pretty much nothing about that
      route that I disliked. I think it could have ended better, but that's a
      very minor complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Susuko</em> herself is very cute, and her VA is doing a great job.
      This is a weird comparison, as they don't sound alike at all, but her
      performance reminded me of
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/people/126/Asami_Sanada"
        target="_blank"
        >Asami Sanade</a
      >. It made me feel the same excitement, I guess. A lot of her characters
      have that effect on me, and <em>Susuko</em> had the same impact. Part of
      that was her dialogue and not just her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding my only and very minor complaint, I would have preferred an
      ending that was not just a rehash of the <em>Ikuko</em> route's ending.
      Overall, though, I liked <em>Susuko's</em> route. Her getting annoyed at
      <em>Jun</em> during some scenes was adorable, and the short interaction
      with her older sister was very cute.
    </p>

    <h3>Epilogues</h3>
    <p>
      I'm going to try to keep what I have to say about
      <em>epilogues for NLNS</em> heroines short. I read these in the order they
      appeared on the scenario screen, as I mentioned earlier in the blogpost,
      and I will talk about them in the same order. Although I talked about the
      <em>Susuko</em> route before this, I read that route after finishing these
      epilogues.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Asane epilogue.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      I don't care for <strong>Asane's epilogue</strong>, and I didn't care for
      her that much either. I am not an incestfag, and none of her scenes were
      that good, so I wasn't turned on by any of the H-scenes. Her role in
      <em>Senzuripoint: Paccoman</em> was better than anything she did in the
      first VN or this epilogue.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Nanase epilogue.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Nanase's epilogue</strong> fixes a lot of the problems from her
      original route, like that route being a de facto bad ending. It has two
      extremely hot scenes, and overall it was an enjoyable and funny epilogue.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Hinami epilogue.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      <em>Hinami</em> is cute as ever, and the added tan makes her even sexier.
      Overall, I liked <strong>Hinami's epilogue</strong>. <em>Rei's</em> scenes
      were adorable, but I wish there had been more of them. The extra scenario
      should have been reworked to be part of the actual epilogue, but it's not
      a big deal.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Misaki epilogue.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Misaki's epilogue</strong> wasn't very interesting. I wrote an
      <code class="inline-class">awk</code> script to calculate the number of
      lines in each route, and hers was the shortest. It didn’t feel short
      though. At least in <em>Nukitashi 1</em>, her route had erotic
      non-H-scenes.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Fumino epilogue.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Fumino's epilogue</strong> is a bit different from the rest, so
      I'll go into more detail. One of the things in <em>Nukitashi 2</em> is
      that it takes place after the grand route, but
      <strong>you don't end up with anyone</strong>. More precisely, it takes
      place after the events of Senzuripoint: Paccoman, but
      <strong>you don't end up with the SS girls</strong>. Instead,
      <strong>you continue your relationship with Fumino</strong> during the
      grand route, (which didn't happen in Senzuripoint: Paccomon) then teleport
      to the other world, and
      <strong>come back to continue your relationship</strong>. That's enough
      about the technicalities though.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find <em>Fumino</em> to be very boring. This epilogue doesn't really
      improve her character or reveal anything too important about her that we
      didn't already know. The yamato nadeshiko archetype isn't that much
      different from the <strong>manic pixie dream girl</strong> when viewed
      through a Japanese lens. Unfortunately, it is hard to pull off because
      most characters with this archetype tend to be
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/i220" target="_blank"
        >kuuderes</a
      >, and <em>kuuderes</em> are very hard to portray effectively. One example
      of a yamato nadeshiko from an eroge that comes to mind is
      <strong>Kikuchiyo</strong> from
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/v27519" target="_blank"
        >doHna:doHna -Issho ni Warui Koto o Shiyou-</a
      >. She was a real cutie, though not a <em>kuudere</em>, so there's that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The epilogue ends somewhat bittersweet, as <em>Jun</em> loses partial
      functionality of his arm and shoulder, enough to cause him trouble in
      daily life. I understand it is supposed to mirror what happened to
      <em>Fumino</em> at the end of her route in <em>Nukitashi 1</em>, but this
      detail felt tacked on to me, to be honest. This epilogue's ending might
      also be the canon ending, but I am not planning on reading
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/v31055" target="_blank"
        >Hentai Prison</a
      >
      anytime soon to find out. If I do read it in the future, I may make a
      blogpost about it.
    </p>

    <h3>Anime and Manga</h3>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Anime.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      The anime was my introduction to <em>Nukitashi</em>, and I think it did a
      decent job adapting the story. It was handled by
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/911/Passione"
        target="_blank"
        >Passione's</a
      >
      softcore team, and they really knocked it out of the park. They can't show
      explicit sex, but they know how to push things right to the edge. The
      problem, of course, is that they had to adapt a
      <strong>40-hour VN</strong> into about <strong>4 hours of anime</strong>.
      The way they approached it was, in my opinion, genius. Not only did they
      pick the most entertaining moments from each route, but they also added
      elements that honestly should have been in the VN in the first place.
      There is plenty of fan service for people who have read both VNs, too.
      They basically said forget <em>Fumino</em>, forget <em>Nanase's</em> route
      being a bad ending, and they even improved <em>Nanase's</em> first sex
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anime goes original from some point onward, which is necessary, since
      the grand route builds upon everything that came before it, and here you
      don't have that luxury with such a short runtime. I think the actual last
      fight of the first VN is superior to the fight at the end here, but that
      wasn't a big deal for me. The anime ends on a happy note:
      <em>Nanase</em> getting her well-deserved <strong>happy ending</strong>,
      <em>Fumino</em> not suffering at the hand of <em>Sakimori</em>, and the
      <em>SS</em> girls not getting screwed over like they did in
      <em>Nanase's</em> <em>Nukitashi 1</em> route.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also teases what's to come, which is <strong>USD</strong>, as
      <em>Hitoura</em> talks about in the epilogue. I think I would enjoy a
      second season adapting <em>Nukitashi 2</em>, though not as much as this
      adaptation, since it would focus on <em>Touka</em> instead of
      <em>Rei</em>. Regardless, I don't think it will happen anytime soon.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Specials.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      Specials are a series of short episodes, four to be exact, that were
      released with the Blu-ray volumes. Each episode is just under five minutes
      long, and they are original content. None of this was in the VN or in any
      other side material I searched through. <em>Passione</em> brought their
      A-game here as well. Each episode focuses on a different heroine from the
      first VN and highlights a defining sexual trait of hers. Just watch it, is
      all I'll say. I liked them a lot.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/Manga.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      The manga is just an adaptation of the <em>Misaki</em> route from
      <em>Nukitashi 1</em>. There's also a sequel (?) manga called
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/183724/Nukitashi_R"
        target="_blank"
      >
        Nukitashi R</a
      >, which is the same thing but for the <em>Hinami</em> route. I couldn't
      read the latter, as it hasn't been translated, but I did read the former.
      It was alright, nothing too special. I am definitely a bigger fan of
      <em>Mameojitan</em> than I am of this manga. He really knows how to add
      eroticism to mundane stuff, which is more apparent here than in his
      doujins.
    </p>

    <h3>Closing notes</h3>
    <p>
      Before closing things out, <strong>Merry Christmas</strong>,
      <em>which has passed</em>, and a <strong>Happy New Year</strong>,
      <em>which is today</em>, <strong>to everyone</strong>. Likewise,
      <strong>Happy Birthday to Jun</strong>, <em>which was just yesterday</em>.
      I know I kept complaining about my procrastination on this blogpost, but
      it was more because of the mental space I was in rather than not wanting
      to write it. Don't get the incorrect idea that I dislike these two VNs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think they are decent for what they are. I am still salty about
      <em>Nanase</em> but what can you do. I gassed up the second VN a lot more
      than the first one, but generally speaking, if I were to attach an actual
      score to them, I would probably rate them the same.
      <em>Nukitashi 1</em> has a solid core while lacking in heroines and routes
      while <em>Nukitashi 2</em> has great heroines and routes but a weak core.
      This is felt the most when comparing <em>Nukitashi 1's</em> grand route's
      climax to any climax <em>Nukitashi 2</em> has to offer. This is not
      something I can easily quantify, but most people would probably agree with
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of this blogpost, I wrote as I was reading the VNs, so I didn't have
      a clear idea of how I felt about everything until the very end. In order
      to better illustrate my point (and because it's fun) I went ahead and made
      a

      and

    <p>
      The next blogpost will come very quickly. It's essentially written and
      edited already, I just have to re-read it and make some final adjustments.
      To give a teaser, it'll be about what I did during my break between
      finishing <em>Nukitashi 1</em> and starting <em>Nukitashi 2</em>. I wrote
      in tandem with this one and it's supposed to be an intermission between
      this blogpost and the <em>Mushoku Tensei</em> blogpost that is coming
      after that.
