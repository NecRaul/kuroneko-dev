    <h3>Shit animu</h3>
    <p>
      Recently I got very depressed after watching something I had hopes for
      turn out to be a massive pile of shit. That thing was
      <strong><em>Phantom: Requiem for Phantom</em></strong
      >. I am still toying with the idea of writing something regarding that
      matter as well, mainly focusing on <em>Urobuchi</em>, rather than just
      Phantom as a VN/Anime.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that dark moment, I decided to return to watching something from the
      animation studio that puts out consistent good anime that I tend to enjoy
      a lot - <strong>Shaft</strong>. I watched
      <strong><em>Soredemo Machi wa Mawatteiru</em></strong> and both seasons of
      <strong><em>Maria†Holic</em></strong
      >. I found Soredemo Machi wa Mawatteiru to be hilarious and the last
      episode also hit me like a truck. I also enjoyed both seasons of
      Maria†Holic, first season more than the second but I digress. This is not
      a blog post about either of those shows.
    </p>

    <h3>Shaft and being different</h3>
    <p>
      If you've been on the bearable side of the internet for any amount of time
      and have interest in anime outside of FOTM shlock put out by most studios,
      watched and either immediately forgotten by the masses or regarded as the
      2nd coming of Jesus despite being middling at best (<em
        >Sousou no Frieren</em
      >), you may have seen Shaft being regarded as the oddball among animation
      studios. I believe that's for a good reason. Personally, I'm a big fan of
      <strong>Akiyuki Shinbo's</strong> work. I enjoyed
      <strong><em>Le Portrait de Petit Cossette</em></strong> which I believe is
      his directorial debut and among the many works he directed, 2 of them made
      my (current) 3x3. So, going back to my original point, Shaft is just
      "different". Not in a good or a bad way per say, but you can most likely
      pick out a Shaft anime from a list if you've seen couple of Shaft anime.
      And it isn't just about that weird thing characters in Shaft adaptations
      do either.
    </p>

    <img class="postimage" src="/images/posts/SHAFT Doggo.gif" />

    <p>I believe there are two types of people that like Shaft anime.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        People who get tired of the repetition of most anime as the medium
        itself is built upon tropes that have been formed a long time ago. Some
        anime tends to fall in line with the tropes whilst others tend to
        subvert them.
      </li>
      <li>
        People who don't really like anime, only watch a handful of really
        popular shows which are generally marketed toward them and in order to
        stand out from rest of their normalfag friends, masquerade as someone
        with a "good taste" by watching "weird" anime.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      While I agree that Shaft anime is "weird" that's not the full picture. I
      believe they have something that other studios don't. At `least not to the
      same degree.
    </p>

    <img class="postimage" src="/images/posts/SHAFT weird.jpg" />

    <p>
      Slight tangent before I continue: I somewhat believe people who like
      <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventures</em> also fall in the second type of people
      who want to be different but that's not the point of this blog post. As a
      matter of fact, neither is discussing why I or anyone else might like or
      dislike Shaft. This blog post is about normalcy, the good kind.
    </p>

    <h3>Normalcy in anime studios</h3>
    <p>
      If you don't belong in either of the aforementioned types of people,
      chances are you may like <strong>Trigger</strong>... and
      <strong>Kyoto Animation</strong>. That doesn't mean everything they do is
      right, just that, everyone else fucks up more frequently or majorly than
      they do. I can say I like both of them to a certain degree, for different
      reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trigger didn't quite save anime as people would like you to believe but
      they have made a good anime or two. Unfortunately that's it, two good
      anime. I think <em>Kill la Kill </em> is decent, I am open to anime
      originals any day of the week, provided they deliver on the concept of the
      story and don't bastardize its concept or plagiarize any previous anime -
      looking at you DitF. I really like the <em>Gridman</em> series. I'm glad
      someone other than Imaishi was in charge of that because Imaishi is a
      one-trick pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, unlike Trigger, but like Shaft, Kyoto Animation has
      also made my 3x3, with Haruhi. This is the part where I explain why I
      dedicated an entire section to fellating Shaft:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In their prime, not only did a lot of people compare these studios, but
        they were also something akin to a rival in my eyes.
      </li>
      <li>
        I watched two Shaft shows for the first time, enjoyed them and recommend
        them to you.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      With that being said, I believe Shaft and Kyoto Animation are massively
      different in both style and substance. Explaining the style portion is
      easy, Kyoto Animation shows look nice but don't share an inherent style
      with one another while Shaft shows look nice but also resemble each other
      in ways that's not easy to explain. Substance is a bit weird. As mentioned
      previously, I really like Haruhi. I own all the available books, I've read
      all translated side-stories, official art and guide books etc., but I have
      reservations about recommending the novels to people. Kyoto Animation did
      a fantastic job bringing those characters to life and I've been asking for
      a season 3 for many years. A comparison would be Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.
      I also really like SZS. I don't own the manga as not all of the volumes
      got published in English but I've shilled it like I'm being paid for it to
      my friends. Unfortunately the anime doesn't end the story and it never
      will due to the unfortunate loss of Miyu Matsuki. All in all, I can't say
      which is the definitive way to experience SZS while I can do the same with
      Haruhi. If I were to simplify what I'm trying to express, it would be
      KyoAni made Haruhi better, while Shaft made SZS different.
    </p>

    <h3>Why I don't like KyoAni anymore</h3>
    <p>
      For whatever reason, Kyoto Animation got worse at making anime that
      <em>Haruhi/Lucky☆Star/KEY</em> crowd enjoyed and eventually stopped making
      that type of anime altogether. I think last great KyoAni production was
      <strong><em>The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya</em></strong> while last
      good KyoAni production was <strong><em>Amagi Brilliant Park</em></strong
      >. Nowadays, instead of adapting decent but not amazing light novels and
      manga, KyoAni has an in-house writing team that writes LN for them to
      adapt. I believe this majorly restricts creativity from both the author's
      and director's side. Some LNs thought to be impossible to adapt - like
      <em>Monogatari</em> have only been made possible due to creativity from
      the anime production side. When you write a story that you know is going
      to be adapted, you may leave out some of your ideas on the cutting floor
      on the grounds that, it may not be possible to show on TV. I can probably
      go on and on about this but my point still stands - KyoAni is at their
      best when adapting a relatively unknown work by someone else, not their
      in-house guys. And no, I'm not gonna act like the fire is to be
      responsible for their recent lack of quality. The second season of Dragon
      Maid happened after the fire and it was better than some of their pre-fire
      shows. And if we're talking about pre-fire KyoAni, as much as I didn't
      care for Hyouka it did something different which is commendable I guess.
    </p>

    <img class="postimage" src="/images/posts/Hyouka collage.jpg" />

    <p>
      <em>Hibike! Euphonium</em> is the worst example of this. I haven't seen a
      single good thing from that entire franchise and no,
      <em>Liz and the Blue Bird</em> was NOT good. Maybe I'm just tired of anime
      that takes place in high school - highly doubtful - but after the
      commercial success of <em>Violet Evergarden</em> - another anime I
      disliked, KyoAni's sensibilities have changed too much for me to consider
      them the same studio as the one that made Haruhi. I am extremely tired of
      seeing perfectly good studios become middling or straight-up bad because
      of some asinine reason. There's a reason why <em>Doga Kobo</em> is winning
      despite doing nothing special. There is a reason why some of their series
      have animators throwing themselves at it, just for the opportunity to work
      on it. Passion, the absolute necessity for any creative work is there.
      That's why even someone like me, who generally dislikes "isekai" went and
      watched <strong><em>Mushoku Tensei</em></strong> and bought all the books,
      because there was passion. Passion from the posters on /a/ who made daily
      threads for entire duration of first season. Passion from the people in
      the anime's production which I will fail to describe no matter how hard I
      may try. Passion from the author who listened to the readers who were
      equally as passionate. Kyoto Animation lacks that passion because they
      have forgotten to work on something for the very fun it will provide.
    </p>

    <h3>Closing notes</h3>
    <p>
      All of this may sound like the ramblings of an old man who misses the
      "good old days", but I'm neither an old man, nor do I have rose-tinted
      glasses about the good old days. I am simply tired of seeing something
      that is supposed to come from within - art being degraded to the state it
      is in now. Unfortunately future looks grim even with all the hope I have.
      <em>Monogatari: Off & Monster Season</em> will have an opening from an
      industry plant musician. A lot of the talent from Shaft left quite a while
      back due to poor working conditions and joined <em>David Production</em>,
      only to make a shitty <em>Stone Ocean</em> adaptation with heavy CGI use.
      <em>Fire Force</em> was good I guess, it made me read the manga but season
      3 is nowhere in sight despite being revealed quite a long time ago. I just
      feel like there's an implosion happening in many industries, all at the
      same time and I'm not too happy about it and as this is my blog, I felt
      the need to vent out my frustrations that has been building up. I'll talk
      about something boring like my Master's dissertation next time maybe.
