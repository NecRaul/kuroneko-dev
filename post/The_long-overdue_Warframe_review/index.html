    <h3>Long time no see</h3>
    <p>
      Every time I sat down to write something about Warframe, I'd get
      distracted one way or another, unable to find the words to describe the
      game - whether it's the good parts or the bad parts. I decided to write a
      review for the game around the time I reached 100 daily logins. I was
      having a lot of fun with the game, and I had done a considerable amount of
      the content, but I still had quite a lot to do. I eventually postponed the
      review and continued playing. I went through my first Prime Access, got
      even better at the game, did solo level-cap and more, and decided I'd do
      my review for day 200. This was also around the time a major update
      dropped for the game, so it made sense. However, things didn't work out as
      I intended, and the review got postponed once more. Today is my day 300
      and also the day I reach LR5, which is the highest rank you can achieve at
      this point in time.

    <h3>My experience with looter shooters</h3>
    <p>
      I started playing Destiny 2 when I was in my first year of university. At
      the time, the game was not F2P or on Steam. I only bought the base game to
      try it out, and it didn't leave much of an impression on me. I didn't have
      anyone to play with, which I would eventually find out is the most fun
      part of Destiny 2. When it came to Steam and became free, a lot more
      people started playing, some of whom were my friends from university. I
      also started playing with people from /vg/'s Destiny general. I'm still
      friends with a lot of the /dg/ guys. To keep things brief, I'll just say I
      really did like Destiny 2, but I didn't like many of the changes, like
      removing old content, sunsetting most of the weapons, not replacing them
      with viable alternatives, and unnecessary nerfs to speedrunning tech which
      eventually led to me dropping the game. Ironically, some of those friends
      (who eventually dropped Destiny 2 later than I did), not wanting to play
      the newest expansion at the behest of other friends, led to me (and them)
      starting to play Warframe together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to preface the rest of this post by saying even though most of
      what I say here will be negative, I did truly enjoy most of my time with
      this game. These are just my gripes with the game.

    <h3>Warbros #1</h3>
    <p>
      I had technically tried Warframe 10 years ago, but my laptop at the time
      couldn't handle the game very well. This new try got me hooked nearly
      instantly. I spent the whole day playing and didn’t do much else for a
      while. However, one of my very early critiques was that much of the game
      is time-gated. To progress, you need new equipment, which requires 12 to
      24 hours (or 84 in the case of frames) to craft. This meant that to get to
      the actual fun part, you had to pace yourself, which is something I'm not
      very good at. Another thing that was hard to get used to was the game's
      premium currency economy. You can play this game without spending a dime
      and make tons of premium currency by being a good trader. However, it's
      not that simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the start, you're spending platinum non-stop on frame and weapon slots,
      and because you don't have any valuable items, making plat is really hard.
      Even when that gets better and you're sitting on a comfortable amount of
      platinum for a beginner, another time-gate stops you from progressing.
      This time-gate is forma. Forma is required to craft some items. It is also
      the most important thing in building your frames and weapons. Early on,
      you don't have access to many good weapons and probably don't have many
      Prime frames unlocked, so there isn't much point in spending forma.
      Eventually, however, you get to a point where you need forma non-stop -
      not just to progress, but also to have fun. It is a very obtuse system.
      Eventually, however, I was making enough plat just by doing what I enjoy
      to make this a non-issue. This is one of my main issues with the game:
      everything is front-loaded. Everything, including the premium currency,
      eventually becomes a commodity you have too much of. I have more plat than
      I can probably spend, and I buy gifts for my friends every now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time-gate I'd like to talk about is something very dear to me, as
      it is the activity I have the most fun doing. I'm talking about Eidolon
      hunts. Simply put, Eidolon hunts are the most complicated thing in
      Warframe. They are not as complicated as raids in Destiny 2 - it’s
      actually a pretty simple (and soloable) activity all things considered -
      but I really like how much it can be optimized. Speaking of which, it's
      not just that it can be optimized, but it must be. Eidolon hunts take
      place in Plains of Eidolon, which has a day and night cycle. Eidolons only
      appear during night, which lasts about an hour, while day is much longer
      in comparison. This, in turn, results in me waiting a very long time
      between Eidolon hunts. Worst of all, when I log into the game and want to
      do a night cycle, I may not have the time to wait for it to turn to night.
      The thing is, Eidolon hunts are very rewarding - well, they used to be.
      With the event I mentioned earlier (Belly of the Beast), you can get all
      the Eidolon rewards in a much shorter time frame with a fraction of the
      effort and time, making the decision to lock Eidolons behind a time cycle
      meaningless. The solution to this problem is also very simple. The second
      most complicated activity, which can also be optimized immensely, is
      Profit-Taker - and unlike Eidolons, you can do Profit-Taker whenever you
      want by just selecting a bounty.

    <h3>1999 2: Boyband Boogaloo</h3>
    <p>
      All of that brings me to the newest Warframe update, which is Techrot
      Encore or Update 38.5. In my humble opinion, Techrot Encore does
      absolutely nothing to improve the game's current state. First of all,
      let's look at what this update added to the game:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="postitem">Temporal Archimedea</li>
      <li class="postitem">3 new arcanes</li>
      <li class="postitem">Technocyte Coda</li>
      <li class="postitem">Höllvania tile set changes</li>
      <li class="postitem">4 new Hex characters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are also a few other additions, like new Augment mods, which I find
      uninteresting and haven’t mentioned, along with a few things I’ve likely
      forgotten to mention. I’ll briefly touch on two things I won’t be
      discussing in depth. First is Temple - I don’t know much about him, I’m
      not very interested, and I’m not a fan of the design. That’s all I care to
      say. Second is Omni Forma, a long-overdue change (just like this review).
      I think it’s a net positive for the game, but let’s be clear: this is DE
      trying to squeeze more plat from your account and more Höllars from your
      wallet. With that out of the way, let’s go over the main additions and
      changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temporal Archimedea is not only a worse version of Deep Archimedea that
      doesn't make sense from a story standpoint (Sister of Parvos/Tenet system
      also suffers from this, but that's another matter), but the new modifiers
      it introduced also make Deep Archimedea worse. Not to mention, enemies you
      fight in Höllvania are not as interesting as their Sanctum counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't really have much to say about the new arcanes. Two of them seem
      extremely niche, if not straight-up bad (not worth using territory), and
      the other one is more of a niche arcane that replaces Arcane Avenger
      (which is not that great to begin with) in some scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not like the grind. I didn't like it when I was doing Kuva Liches, I
      didn't like it when I was doing Tenet Sisters, and I sure don't like it
      when it comes to Coda Adversaries. Some props are due, as I think they
      have improved on the barrier-to-entry problem (the aforementioned
      front-loaded issue) compared to the previous two systems, but it doesn't
      make the actual grind any better. I may not have minded this system as
      much if not for the next point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The changes to the Höllvania tile set are straight-up awful. I already
      disliked the maps due to them being either extremely open or extremely
      closed with no in-between, but these changes make the tile set even worse
      than it already was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being unable to romance the 4 new Hex characters, unlike the previous
      Protoframes, is a tad bit disappointing. However, I'm not sure if I would
      even romance them at all. I think Velimir and Minerva being a married
      couple that drifted apart and you being able to fix their relationship if
      you make the right choices is neat. I probably wouldn't date either of
      them, even though I like their designs more than the previous Protoframes.
      Flare is not very interesting to me, as mentioned earlier. One of my
      friends told me he's supposed to be David Bowie, but I don't see it. If
      you combine the "Aladdin Sane" album cover and Jareth from "Labyrinth",
      maybe there's a similarity, but he looks more like Visual Kei meets KISS'
      Ace Frehley to me. Kaya is hot but rather uninteresting and, at times,
      straight-up annoying. DE said this is the last of the Protoframes, but I
      kinda don't believe it. I didn't buy any of the skins (for myself), but I
      know they made a lot of money, so I think they'll go back on their word
      and release more Protoframes - if not just skins. I think the potential
      income will outweigh the integrity in this case.
    </p>

    <h3>Closing notes</h3>
    <p>
      I have very few good things to say about the new Warframe update. I don't
      think it is bad enough to warrant me dropping the game as I did with
      Destiny 2, but it sure isn't good, fun, or entertaining for me. Sorry if
      this review comes off disjointed or even slightly schizoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listen to music most of the time I play Warframe, and about a week ago,
      I finally listened to Neutral Milk Hotel's "In the Aeroplane Over the
      Sea". That shit sucks, and /mu/ as a collective has shit taste.
