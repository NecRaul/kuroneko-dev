    <h3>I've become so apathetic</h3>
    <p>
      I just want to be left alone. I've become so apathetic and I know that's
      not a good thing. It's a failure of mine which I haven't been able to fix
      for a while. I am doing great in life but every time I have to listen to
      other people, it feels like the rabbits from Re:Zero are eating me from
      inside. This doesn't happen with everyone but it happens often enough
      where it demoralizes me.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is especially a problem when I have to deal with people as opposed to
      just one person. You know, I love dealing with people when it's just one
      guy. I'm compassionate, blah blah blah, but as soon as that one person
      becomes multiple, I don't want to deal with this shit anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very opposite of this concept is true for most, if not all leftist.
      They love "people" but as soon as it comes to one person, FUCK THAT GUY. I
      hate leftists a lot too.

    <h3>I HATE PREACHING</h3>
    <p>
      I don't care what you have to say about anything. If you want to relay any
      information to me that badly, I can't help but think you're gonna cause
      some headache for me and I also think you're lying. If you are being nice
      to me for some reason, I'm pretty sure you're gonna fuck me and I can't
      help but think you have skeletons in your closet. If I try to help you,
      I'm pretty sure you will take that in a bad way because you're retarded. I
      realize those last two sentences sound contradictory, that's because they
      are and I don't care. I don't want to hear from you. I think you're lying
      to me for personal gain. I especially don't want to hear from someone who
      is speaking like an authority but has nothing to back them up. I don't
      even wanna listen to you even if you share my opinion on something. Every
      time people preach to me, I get annoyed and want to do the opposite.

      is worse than Mahjong Soul Pon. I was really looking forward to it too,
      since first season was so comfy.

      Destiny 2's latest expansion and raid seems horrible. I haven't played in
      couple of years but some of my friends want to get back into the game. A
      devious plan to not play Destiny 2 was crafted. We're playing Warframe
      instead.
