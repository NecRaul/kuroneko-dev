    <h3>Little bit of backstory</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a big fan of Haruhi Suzumiya, both the books and the anime. I've read
      all the books at least once, some of them more than that, and I join in on
      the /a/ streams whenever I remember them or see them in the catalog.
      Today, I was supposed to watch Terminator with my friends, but hours after
      I had woken up, there was a blackout in my neighborhood, and it wasn't a
      short one. I picked up my PS Vita, started playing Hyperdimension Neptunia
      Re;Birth2 SISTERS GENERATION until the battery ran out. Left with nothing
      to do, I used my phone's light to re-read The Intuition of Haruhi
      Suzumiya. This book was a big deal when it came out, considering it had
      been almost 10 years since The Surprise of Haruhi Suzumiya. So, yeah, I
      just read it, with hindsight about the whole "whodunit" being on my side,
      and here are my opinions on Haruhi's future as of late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I'm a big fan of the books and the anime, I was very late to the
      party on the Haruhi train. By the time I got acquainted with Haruhi,
      everything except Intuition was out, so I didn't have to ponder whether or
      not there was a continuation to all of this. And yes, I'm aware that The
      Theater of Haruhi Suzumiya (tentative title maybe idk) has been announced
      and will be released sometime in the future. I didn't have to question if
      a plot point would be relevant in the future; I just had to read the rest
      of the books to get my answer (here's a salute to everyone who had to wait
      4 years for the conclusion to The Dissociation of Haruhi Suzumiya). Now,
      though, that same train of thought is not true.
    </p>

    <h3>Onto the point</h3>
    <p>
      Haruhi was never the main character in her series; it was always Kyon,
      with her being a very good character. I'd argue she didn't even get to do
      as much as the other colorful individuals in the SOS Brigade. This
      couldn't be more true in "Intuition." Although she's more proactive in
      Tsuruya's challenge, Koizumi, and to a much lesser extent, T, take the
      main role. As we learn later on, the whole challenge was orchestrated by
      the <span class="spoiler">"Mystery Research Club."</span> So, this begs
      the question: will they have an actual importance in the story?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my favorite stories and episodes from Haruhi Suzumiya is "The Day
      of Sagittarius." It's got a lot of good moments relating to Yuki, but it
      also uses previously introduced characters brilliantly. In Intuition, not
      only is a new character introduced, a group of characters are teased, and
      a previous character gets a decent spotlight. In turn, this makes me
      wonder if the same will happen in the future with characters from Surprise
      (you know the ones) and Intuition (T and Mystery Research Club).
    </p>
    <p>
      I should mention that I'm not a huge fan of any of the characters
      introduced (or used, I should say) in Surprise. I dislike Sasaki and her
      way of talking. Maybe it's the way it's translated to English, but it
      feels very smug and condescending to the reader, not in a way it would
      feel to Kyon. The others are alright, but they suffer slightly from the
      fact that we don't spend that much time with them. Now, considering all of
      this, I only have one hope, which is that all of my worries are
      unwarranted and Tanigawa-san will deliver on everything just like he has
      done many times over.
