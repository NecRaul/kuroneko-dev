    <h3>Memorable monologues</h3>
    <p>
      Every weekend, a couple of friends and I gather for a movie night. On one
      such occasion, we watched the 1976 film
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/network/"
        target="_blank"
        >Network</a
      >. If I'm being honest, I didn't really enjoy it. It had its moments, but
      they were too few and far between for my taste. However,
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwMVMbmQBug"
        target="_blank"
        >two</a
      >
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuBe93FMiJc"
        target="_blank"
        >scenes</a
      >
      in particular stood out to me. Both were monologues delivered by two very
      different characters with differing motivations. As such, the monologues
      also contradicted each other on some level. Regardless of whether they
      aligned with my political or psychological worldview, I was impressed by
      the way they were delivered and the impact they had on, not only me but
      the story as a whole. In a way, they were the driving force behind
      everything that happened in the film.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another similar yet fundamentally different monologue appears near the
      very end of
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239200/Amnesia_A_Machine_for_Pigs/"
        target="_blank"
        >Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs</a
      >, delivered by the main antagonist, <em>the Machine</em>. Unlike the
      previous example,
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcsi3hU-rX8"
        target="_blank"
        >this monologue</a
      >
      isn't the driving force behind the main character's motivations and
      actions but rather an explanation of the main antagonist's. It offers
      insight into <em>the Machine's</em> psyche and helps the player understand
      why everything unfolded the way it did. It's worth noting that, much like
      <em>Network</em>, I didn't particularly enjoy
      <em>Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs</em>. However, in both cases, the
      monologues managed to stay with me, months in the first case and years in
      the second, long after I experienced them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The last example I'm going to give is one I don't have much context for,
      as I haven't played the game or any games in the franchise. I usually have
      a YouTube video or a Twitch stream running in the background while I go
      about my day, and in one such instance, the video happened to be an
      explanation of the story behind the
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s"
        target="_blank"
        >Five Nights at Freddy's</a
      >
      franchise. Needless to say, the story and the way it's presented are very
      convoluted, and since I only had it on in the background, I wasn't really
      following much of it. However, at one point, the creator of the video
      mentioned that the following
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Q_e6hxyyA"
        target="_blank"
        >monologue</a
      >
      was very important within the story's context and that it had greatly
      impressed him. I didn't stop what I was doing to watch it, but the clear
      shift in tone and the way it disrupted the video's flow made me take
      notice. I suppose I should move on from these specific examples and talk
      about what it is exactly about monologues like these and many others I've
      encountered over the years that has made them stick with me.
    </p>

    <h3>Momentum</h3>
    <p>
      Every story moves forward at its own pace until a monologue brings that
      momentum to a sudden halt. There are a few factors to consider when this
      happens. Was this interruption necessary? Was it expected, or did it come
      out of left field? Is its length too short, too long, or just right? Did
      the character naturally break into it, or was it the author taking
      control? You don't need to get all of these aspects right to craft a good
      monologue, but the more boxes you check, the better the result tends to
      be. I mentioned earlier that I wouldn't give more examples or discuss
      whether my worldview aligns with a given monologue, but it's important to
      introduce a very famous one as a point of reference to explain the
      reasoning behind these questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged"
        target="_blank"
        >Atlas Shrugged</a
      >
      is a novel written by
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand"
        target="_blank"
        >Ayn Rand</a
      >
      and published in 1957. It's a highly polarizing book, but one that I
      happen to love. My worldview almost completely aligns with everything
      written in it. <em>Ayn Rand</em> herself doesn't shy away from making her
      philosophy known, and in one particular instance, she has one of her main
      characters, <em>John Galt</em>, deliver a monologue that goes on for quite
      some time, even by the standards of a 1,000 page novel. Now, as I
      mentioned, I love this book, I love <em>Ayn Rand</em>, and my worldview
      aligns with much of what <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> conveys. However, I
      absolutely loathed reading that monologue.
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer the questions I posed earlier, the monologue delivered by
      <em> John Galt</em> is both necessary and expected, given the context of
      the story. However, I think it fails miserably in the last two areas. The
      length, as I've already mentioned, is excessive, but the greater issue is
      that, although these are things <em>John Galt</em> would say, it becomes
      painfully clear that control has shifted from the character to the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned how monologues are meant to pause a story's momentum, but in
      the case of <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, that monologue completely killed it
      for me. After reading it, I had to take a long break because I just
      couldn't continue. The reason the momentum died wasn't that it was paused
      by a monologue but it was stolen by <em>Ayn Rand</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, I should mention that in the previous examples I gave,
      the monologues were audiovisual, unlike Atlas Shrugged, which features a
      written one. The content of a monologue is important, but its delivery and
      the way it's presented greatly affects how it's perceived.
    </p>

    <h3>Fourth Wall</h3>
    <p>
      I tried to avoid bringing this up until now because the inclusion of the
      fourth wall opens up a whole new can of worms. While one could argue that
      the "I'm mad as hell" monologue in <em>Network</em> breaks the fourth
      wall, what I'm referring to is something more concrete and
      distinguishable. In this case, I consider it breaking the fourth wall when
      an established narrator or a character in the story directly addresses the
      audience and delivers a monologue.
    </p>

    <p>
      An example that fits this category could be the ending of
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/american-psycho/"
        target="_blank"
        >American Psycho</a
      >, several scenes in
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/ferris-buellers-day-off/"
        target="_blank"
        >Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a
      >, or the essay written by the students in
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-breakfast-club/"
        target="_blank"
        >The Breakfast Club</a
      >. However, the best example that comes to mind is the narrative style of
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/fight-club/"
        target="_blank"
        >Fight Club</a
      >. In <em>Fight Club</em>, the narrator breaks the fourth wall multiple
      times, and one could even argue that the monologue itself is broken into
      several parts spread throughout the film. Generally speaking, I dislike
      breaking the fourth wall through monologues. Among the examples mentioned,
      <em>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</em> is the most jarring of the four.
      However, <em>Fight Club</em> is a masterful use of this technique, and it
      works wonderfully within the context of the story.
    </p>

    <h3>Closing notes</h3>
    <p>
      I'd like to give a definitive answer to the question I posed, "the worth
      of a monologue", but I don't think I can. It depends not only on the
      context of the story but also on the personal tastes of the audience. What
      I can say is that a well-executed monologue can leave a lasting impression
      and elevate a story to new heights, or in some cases, be the only
      memorable part of an otherwise mediocre one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been away for quite some time. A lot has happened since my last
      blogpost, both in my personal life and in the world. I actually had a post
      drafted a few months ago, but so much has changed that I'd have to scrap
      it and start over to include more recent events. I think I'll still write
      that monologue, but it's going to take a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, I played, read and watched bunch of stuff but the couple
      that I'd like to talk about are
      <a

        href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1608290/GNOSIA/"
        target="_blank"
        >Gnosia</a
      >,
      <a
        class="link-highlight"

        target="_blank"
        >Mushoku Tensei</a
      >
      and
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/v22899" target="_blank"
        >Nukitashi</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hated <em>Gnosia</em>. I could go on and on about it, but essentially,
      the game is a massive time sink if you get screwed by the RNG, and I
      certainly did. Ignoring the fact that it's a stat-driven game instead of
      the logical deduction game it pretends to be, the story is mediocre at
      best, and the characters are hit or miss. Because of how the game is
      structured, you barely get any information about them throughout your
      playtime, and at some point, wanting to know more about the characters
      becomes a nuisance since it's the only way to finish the game. I watched
      the first episode of the currently airing
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/60427/Gnosia"
        target="_blank"
        >anime adaptation</a
      >, but I haven't continued it since.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's been a little while since I finished reading
      <em>Mushoku Tensei</em> and all the side material associated with it, but
      it's still fresh in my mind. I'm planning to make a separate blogpost to
      talk about it in greater detail, but overall, I enjoyed most of my time
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm still in the process of reading <em>Nukitashi</em>. So far, I've
      finished the common route and three heroine routes in the first game, and
      I'm currently on the true route. Just like <em>Mushoku Tensei</em>, I'll
      make a separate blogpost to talk about it in more detail, but for now, I
      should mention that I'm really excited to read the second entry in the
      series. I got interested in <em>Nukitashi</em> after watching the
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/57969/Nukitashi_the_Animation"
        target="_blank"
        >anime adaptation</a
      >
      that aired a while ago, and I don't regret my decision to start reading
      it. It was voted VN of the Year by /vn/, and even though I don't keep up
      with new visual novels, I can see why it earned that title. From what I've
      gathered, and from what people on /a/ threads have told me, the second VN
      is a lot better than the first one, and I choose to believe them because
      my favorite part of the first VN so far has been the Hinami route,
      specifically the interactions with Rei. Overall, the interactions with the
      SS girls have been really entertaining. The
      <em>Nukitashi</em> blogpost will come before the <em>Mushoku Tensei</em>
      one, but I want to finish the first VN and read the second before I start
      writing again.
