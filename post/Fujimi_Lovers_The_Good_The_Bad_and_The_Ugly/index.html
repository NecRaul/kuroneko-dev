    <h3>Prelude</h3>
    <p>
      I have been disappointed over and over by romance anime and manga.
      Sometimes it's because my preferred girl doesn't win; other times, it
      drags on for too long despite whatever made it unique having run its
      course; and very rarely, it's because a very good concept is butchered for
      one reason or another. Along with that, my particular taste in romance is
      somewhat niche. My favorite romance stories aren't solely romance but use
      romance as just one plot device. <em>Sugaru Miaki's</em> stories are an
      example of this. The one romance manga that I absolutely love is
      <em>Ookami Shounen wa Kyou mo Uso wo Kasaneru</em>, and that one is pure
      romance. Fujimi Lovers could've been another such manga, except it doesn't
      have an ending. After three volumes and a perspective shift, the
      continuation was supposed to come in the form of a Part 2, but alas, that
      never happened. One of my favorite concepts was met with discontinuation.
      Ten years after the fact, whilst browsing /a/, I came across a thread
      saying they were making a live-action adaptation and finally bringing the
      story to its conclusion. Due to it being a Japanese live-action movie, I
      knew I would need to wait quite a while to watch it. There is also the
      fact that, although overacting is prevalent in Japanese movies, I was not
      wholly optimistic about whether or not the main character could be
      properly adapted, considering how exaggerated some parts of the original
      story tend to make him act. In the meantime, a special oneshot from the
      original author dropped, supposedly also bringing a conclusion to the
      story. This time, I was overjoyed. Nobody else could've done justice to
      this story other than the original author herself, I believed. In this
      blog post, I will try to give my concise opinion on the original Fujimi
      Lovers manga, the 2024 movie, and the oneshot. I am quite sick at the
      moment, so my opinions may not come off as concise, but I'm very
      passionate about the matter at hand. Forgive anything that might come off
      as verbose or disjointed. This will contain spoilers for all three of the
      aforementioned stories.

    <h3>Fujimi Lovers the manga</h3>
    <p>
      The Fujimi Lovers manga has a simple concept I had never seen elsewhere.
      The main character, <em>Kouno Jun</em>, is in love with a girl named
      <em>Hasebe Rino</em>. Every time he confesses his love to her, and his
      feelings are met with mutual love, the girl in question disappears, and
      everyone else who is supposed to know of her also forgets her existence.
      She then reappears sometime later with no memory of Jun and a completely
      different backstory and circumstances to boot. It is a sweet and sour
      antithesis to the concept of Red Thread of Fate. We accompany Jun in his
      unwavering determination to love and gain the affection of Rino, no matter
      the circumstances, and those circumstances can be excruciating at times.
      Nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, phases my boy Jun as he charms
      Rino in all her various iterations: when she's a teacher and he's a high
      school student; a middle school student with unrequited feelings for
      another boy while Jun is a university student; a grade-school student
      while Jun is a university student; a widow still harboring deep feelings
      for her late husband; and many more versions of Rino, each cuter than the
      last. During all this, Jun meets a girl named <em>Hanamori</em>, who has
      experienced the exact same phenomenon. Unlike Jun, however, Hanamori has
      given up her pursuit of the impossible love quest. She happens to fall for
      Jun, but because of his love for Rino, she is met with heartbreak. Jun
      sympathizes with her heartbreak because one of Rino's iterations was also
      in love with someone else. I will mention two more Rino iterations, which
      I purposely avoided describing earlier.
    </p>

    <img class="postimage" src="/images/posts/Heartbreak.png" />

    <p>
      Hasebe Rino, a university student and classmate of Kouno Jun, has memories
      of only the current day. To elaborate: after an accident, she was struck
      with a condition that makes her unable to remember anything after she has
      gone to sleep. Her actual memory ends at the age of 16, which is when the
      accident occurred. To maintain some semblance of normalcy in her life, she
      keeps notes of everything she experiences during the day. However, in
      truth, her life is in tatters, as her memory issues make daily life
      incredibly difficult. This iteration of Rino elevates the already
      impossible love story to an entirely new level, as Jun must restart his
      efforts to win her heart every single day.

    <p>
      He starts living with her family (her grandparents to be specific) and
      helping her every day. A very sweet aspect of this part of the story is
      that, although her memory may not persist, bit by bit, her feelings begin
      to linger. I'm not a romantic at heart, but I love the implication that
      love (and other emotions) can be stored elsewhere - perhaps in
      <strong>the heart</strong> (<em>KUBOOOOOOOOOO</em>). Eventually, Rino
      answers Jun's unwavering feelings of love. At this point, the only thing
      Jun can do is plead with her: to stay awake, to not forget his existence,
      his feelings, and the love she feels for him. This iteration ends
      beautifully, with her briefly dozing off for a moment, then waking up -
      and remembering all three of those things.
    </p>

    <p>
      The last Rino I'll talk about is also the final one we see in the manga.
      One day on campus, while Jun is talking with Hanamori-san, a girl - more
      specifically, Hasebe-san asks if she can take a UMA club flyer stuck to
      Jun's back. It's her, in the flesh, yet, to Jun's surprise, he doesn't
      feel anything. Shortly after, we learn this girl's true identity:
      <em>Hasebe Rina</em>, the twin sister of Hasebe Rino. Although this was
      pretty obvious, it reiterates two key things. First, Kouno Jun's love for
      Hasebe Rino is on a completely unique and profound level - it isn't about
      outward appearance, personality, or any superficial traits. Second, Jun's
      determination is truly unwavering, as if he's an arrow in flight,
      incapable of being diverted from its target.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jun and the Rino of this iteration share similar interests, which leads
      them to hit it off quite well. In one of the previous iterations, Jun had
      mentioned the fact that every time his feelings for Rino are reciprocated,
      she disappears - but that revelation happened near the very end of that
      plotline. This time, however, he reveals his love and the truth about
      Rino's disappearance to him much earlier in their story. Rather than
      treating Jun like heâ€™s insane, Rino surprises Jun by inviting him on a
      camping trip (and a hunt for Tsuchinoko - UMAs are one of their shared
      interests). During the trip, they grow closer, and Rino offers his
      conclusion to Jun's predicament: he suggests that Jun give up on pursuing
      mutual love in order to preserve their current relationship. Jun has
      pondered this possibility countless times before, yet his answer remains
      steadfast - he will live true to his desire for mutual love, no matter how
      impossible it seems. He continues to profess his love for Rino again and
      again, which only deepens the confusion in Rino's mind, now filled with
      conflicting emotions. Finally, Jun urges Rino to leave him, insisting that
      the one thing he cannot deny is his unwavering love for Rino, despite the
      seeming impossibility of their being together.

    <p>
      Jun stays by himself in the mountains, but sometime later, Rino returns,
      worried about him. Unfortunately, he ends up lost and injured. Jun finds
      him, and the two encounter a bear. In a desperate bid to escape, they make
      a Hail Mary leap into a nearby lake. Both are later rescued and taken to a
      hospital by Jun's friend, Tanaka. At the hospital, it is revealed that the
      jump caused Jun to suffer retrograde amnesia. Despite this, his feelings
      for Rino remain intact. Rino's internal conflict finally reaches its
      resolution when he realizes that he, too, harbors feelings of love for
      Jun. Bracing himself for the inevitable disappearance that comes with
      mutual love, something completely unexpected happens - this time, it is
      Jun who disappears. Everyone, except Tanaka, forgets Jun's existence.
      Tanaka, the sole exception, takes Rino to where Jun is now. In a
      surprising twist, it is revealed that Jun has reappeared as a female. This
      revelation reignites Rino's conflicting emotions, but he ultimately
      decides to be true to his feelings, just as Jun has been all along. With
      this resolve, Rino commits to chasing after Jun, fully aware that Jun will
      eventually disappear when Rino's love finally bears fruit.

    <p>
      In retrospect, it's easy to say that this story was doomed from the start
      - either because it relied too heavily on a single concept or because it
      seemingly had nowhere to go. However, I truly believed that some kind of
      satisfying conclusion could have been achieved. After the announcement of
      the movie, followed by the release of the oneshot, I had convinced myself
      of this. With that out of the way, itâ€™s time to talk about how my hopes
      ultimately led to disappointment.
    </p>

    <h3>Fujimi Lovers the movie</h3>
    <p>
      I'll try to keep my thoughts about the movie (and the oneshot that
      followed) brief, as I didnâ€™t enjoy them and certainly wonâ€™t enjoy
      discussing them. In the movie, Rino is made the main character instead of
      Jun. Some iterations from the manga were omitted - such as the JCÃ—JD and
      JSÃ—JD romances - which could have caused issues, but I wasnâ€™t too bothered
      by their absence. Being a live-action adaptation featuring Rino, whose
      emotions are more subdued compared to the mangaâ€™s Jun, the exaggerated
      charm and energy of the manga didnâ€™t translate to the big screen. While
      these are minor complaints, I do have two significant issues, both of
      which partially apply to the oneshot as well. My first major complaint is
      the movieâ€™s over-reliance on the iteration of Jun that loses his memories
      every day. While that version of Rino was certainly a standout in the
      manga, it was not the focus of the entire story. The core of the manga was
      always the simple yet poignant fact that every time Junâ€™s feelings were
      reciprocated, Rino would disappear. My second complaint, however, is
      absolutely outrageous. The story deviates entirely from the supernatural
      and unexplainable nature of the disappearances. Instead, it becomes a
      matter of Rino choosing to forget whoever she was in love with after a
      breakup, a falling out, or some other emotional event. The implication is
      that there was never just one "Jun" - instead, Rino was in love with
      different people at different periods in her life. This shift is hinted at
      twice during the movie: once by Tanaka (who is Rinoâ€™s friend instead of
      Junâ€™s in this version) and once by Hanamori-sanâ€™s sudden disappearance. My
      issue isnâ€™t that this twist came out of nowhere; I think the movie did
      enough to establish it beforehand. However, it still felt entirely
      meaningless. This concept is vastly inferior to the mangaâ€™s simple yet
      effective portrayal of impossible love.

    <h3>Fujimi Lovers the oneshot</h3>
    <p>
      The oneshot follows the same general story as the manga for the most part,
      but, as mentioned in the movie section, it places too much emphasis on the
      iteration of Rino who forgets her memories each day. God makes an
      appearance and tells Jun that their love is not meant to be, yet despite
      this, Jun and the memory-affected Rino still end up together, growing old
      and eventually dying. Considering this was meant to be the grand finale to
      the manga after a 10-year wait, this 80-something-page oneshot - half of
      which was just regurgitated content - left me deeply disappointed. While
      it was sweet and cute, and technically provided a conclusion, none of that
      really mattered when the central plot point of Rinoâ€™s disappearances was
      discarded in favor of having the two characters end up together. I did
      want them to be together, but I wanted it to make sense within the context
      of the original storyâ€™s constraints, not by abandoning the very thing that
      made the story unique in the first place.
    </p>

    <h3>Postlude</h3>
    <p>
      I guess I had to re-learn the age-old lesson that getting more of what I
      initially liked will most likely end up disappointing me. I still like the
      Fujimi Lovers manga, but Iâ€™ll have to be content with never getting a
      proper conclusion to the story. I had thought about typesetting the
      oneshot for a while, but laziness and the lingering disappointment
      ultimately overcame my desire to do so. In other news, I want to talk
      about Warframe. I've been putting it off for far too long, and I'll try to
      make an effort to finally put my thoughts about the game into words.
