    <h3>Renovations and its consequences</h3>

        target="_blank"
        >Mushoku Tensei</a
      >, I had an abundance of free time on my hands in-between reading two VNs.
      I already explained this was due to renovations, but I'd like to give more
      context. Simply put, my room's renovations took way longer than expected.
      I had already disassembled my PC, desk, and bed and moved them, along with
      all other furniture out of my room, when the manual laborers who worked on
      the rest of the house informed me they couldn't come by for a couple of
      days. This couple of days turned into a little longer than a week, and
      more problems ensued during the renovation process, which extended the
      time where I couldn't access my PC to read
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/v23741" target="_blank"
        >Nukitashi 2</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this abundance of free time, having nothing else to do, I re-read
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://vndb.org/v945" target="_blank"
        >Katawa Shoujo</a

    </p>
    <p>
      Two things to mention: First, I won't be talking about
      <em>Katawa Shoujo</em> here, as it deserves its own blogpost, although I
      can't guarantee that it will get one. Second, most of these are my loosely
      connected, lightly edited notes that I wrote down on what I thought about
      these movies right after I had seen them. I put a bit more effort into the
      ones I really liked or had been looking forward to watching. I also tried
      to put more effort into the manga section, but admittedly, it's much
      harder to write about a manga I've read over the course of a couple of
      years than it is to jot down my thoughts about a movie I just watched.
    </p>

    <h3>Media Stack</h3>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Intermission_movies_manga_and_me/Media Stack.png"
    />

    <p>
      I had decided on not going into much detail regarding the media stack, but
      I spent a considerable amount of time getting everything the way I wanted,
      so now I feel compelled to write about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial setup, using some official <em>Arch Linux</em> packages and
      some <em>AUR</em> packages of
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://jellyfin.org/" target="_blank"
        >Jellyfin</a
      >
      and
      <a class="link-highlight" href="https://wiki.servarr.com/" target="_blank"
        >Arr applications</a
      >, was pretty easy and worked pretty well. I could download movies from my
      phone (or TV, but it would've been a pain to search for movies with a TV
      remote) and watch them on the Android TV Jellyfin client (or on my phone,
      but you get the idea). However, I didn't wanna dedicate a couple of
      gigabytes on my root partition to just a media stack, so I migrated
      everything over to <strong><em>Docker</em></strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't worked with <em>Docker</em> or other container services that
      much, since generally someone else set up everything at my job and I only
      had to run it. I have worked with <em>YAML</em> for
      <strong>CI/CD</strong> stuff before, so that part wasn't unfamiliar. The
      only annoyance was the lack of good documentation for the different images
      I was using.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a home directory for the <em>Docker</em> user and eventually set up
      everything perfectly. I liked this workflow with containers so much I even
      migrated my <strong>qBittorrent</strong> instance. I still prefer the QT
      client over the web client, but the difference between them is minimal,
      and I could use the web client effectively right away. The last thing I
      added to my media stack was <em>Jellyseerr</em>, which I'll use to get
      requests from my friends for any movies they might want to watch. Down the
      line, I want to build a dedicated NAS with redundancy just for this type
      of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for a dashboard, I was using
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer"
        target="_blank"
        >Homer</a
      >
      for a while, but eventually I found
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://github.com/glanceapp/glance"
        target="_blank"
        >Glance</a
      >, which is a more featureful and nicer-looking alternative. I even
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://github.com/NecRaul/glance"
        target="_blank"
        >cloned the repo</a
      >, made some PRs, and published

        target="_blank"
        >my own Docker image</a
      >
      with patches for personal use until they merge my PRs.
    </p>

    <h3>Kinography</h3>
    <p>
      Since I had so much time with no computer at my disposal, I watched
      <em>a lot of movies</em> in a short period of time and thought about what
      movies I really love. Along with this post, I've added a Kino section to
      my <a class="link-highlight" href="/3x3/" target="_blank">3x3</a> page,
      and soon enough, a music section should follow, where I put my favorite
      albums.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      I'm not a movie lover. I'm not even a movie "liker". Most movies I don't
      care for in general, but out of the new movies I watched,
      <a
        class="link-highlight"

        target="_blank"

      >
      and

        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/buffalo-66/"
        target="_blank"
        >Buffalo '66</a
      >
      instantly became some of my favorite movies of all time. Both of these
      movies have very different themes and styles, and I liked them for
      different reasons. They each made me feel very different things. I was
      laughing my ass off at <em>Trainspotting</em> and how it undermines
      everything that happens in a junkie's life, contrary to movies like
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsCIXxR64mY"
        target="_blank"
        >Requiem for a Dream</a
      >
      where everything is taken so seriously that some of the over the top
      scenes become comedic. I was enamored and fascinated by the tension and
      the beauty portrayed in <em>Buffalo '66</em>. I don't really care about
      the criticism people have for it or how it might be seen as harmful. It
      was a movie that was worth every second, and God willing, I'll watch it
      many more times in the future.

        >Equilibrium</a
      >
      had decent action set pieces, especially the very first and last ones,
      were pretty great, but the movie itself failed to impress me in terms of
      everything else. The story was laughable. The one thing aside from the
      action scenes I liked was the idea that everything would be fixed in a day
      with no drugs to suppress emotion and feelings due to human nature.

    <p>

      >
      was pretty funny all the way through, and I think it might be a movie I go
      back to with friends from time to time. Some scenes made me pause the
      movie because my laughter was disrupting the experience of others who were
      watching the movie with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rewatched the
      <a

      featuring <em>Shurik</em>, and they were just as entertaining as I
      remembered. Since I have a crush on <em>Natalya Varley</em>, I decided to
      watch
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/viy/"
        target="_blank"
        >Viy</a
      >
      for the first time as well and was pleasantly surprised by it.
      <em>Viy</em> does a lot of things well, and just the last 10 to 15 minutes
      is <strong>one of the best sequences in Soviet cinema</strong> I've seen.
      Its ending is somewhat left to interpretation, and even ignoring that,
      this is one of those movies where each person will have a somewhat
      different interpretation of the explored themes. I myself might have a
      different interpretation of them in subsequent watches. Overall, it's a
      pretty good movie, definitely worth watching.
    </p>

      I rewatched

      straightforward and positive message one can and should take to heart.

      is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I regret watching it. I'm
      almost sure it is supposed to be propaganda, but they failed miserably at
      it, and the film turned into a joke. I felt the same way about

      one having a lot of good moments, albeit being a little rushed due to
      having multiple villains in it. The ending of the first movie was like
      that scene from <em>Ratatouille</em>, where I was taken back to my
      childhood with the gosh darn
      <a

      playing as the credits are flowing. It's nice to go back to some movies to
      see that time has treated them very well, and I enjoy them as much as I
      did back in the day.

      Although I haven't watched it recently, the same thing could be said about
      the first

      top, this time from

      who are trying to operate on him. Essentially, <em>Sam Raimi</em>, to me,
      is first and foremost a horror movie director, and that scene reminded me
      of <em>Evil Dead</em> so much. The third movie's standout scene, to
      nobody's surprise, is the

      in the second movie where he changes his opinion of
      <em>Spider-Man</em> due to <em>Dr. Octopus'</em> rampage and kidnapping of
      <em>Mary Jane</em>, and how he does a 180 as soon as
      <em>Spider-Man</em> steals back his uniform. Some of the shots in the
      movie will live rent free in my head for a while, like
      <em>Spider-Man</em> swinging through the city towards
      <em>Dr. Octopus</em>, only for it to zoom out and then transition into the
      view from <em>Dr. Octopus'</em> glasses.

      Just like how I think <strong>Sam Raimi</strong> is
      <em>one of the best directors still alive</em>, I feel the same about
      <strong>Willem Dafoe</strong> regarding actors. I cannot imagine the first
      movie being as good as it is without him in it. You can change the
      villains or even the main characters' actors and actresses, and it
      wouldn't be such a downgrade. I didn't mention this in the
      <em>Streets of Fire</em> section earlier, but he's great in that movie as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from what I already wrote, the elevator scene in the second movie
      felt <strong>Evangelionesque</strong> to me. The justice and its purpose,
      and how it should be enacted, was very sincere, from the reason
      <em>Peter</em> became <em>Spider-Man</em> to <em>Aunt Mary's</em> speech
      about how revenge drives men to do unjust things, and how they shouldn't
      be glad to see her beloved husband's murderer being killed by a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      And don't even get me started on the character moments. All the things
      I've talked about are great, but the real meat and potatoes are the
      character moments. From the first talk between <em>Mary Jane</em> and
      <em>Peter</em> in the backyard, to the break-up on the bridge, to
      <em>Gwen Stacy's</em> sadness followed by the apology to
      <em>Mary Jane</em> based on the fact she was used by emo <em>Peter</em>,
      all of it is gold. Even the emo <em>Peter</em> stuff is great! I know this
      part of the blogpost feels more disjointed, but that's because I'm
      fanboying and can't express what I feel for these movies sufficiently
      enough.

      <em>Star Wars</em> was kind of a stinker. I watched both the originals and
      the prequels, and although I liked some of the human characters and, at
      times, <em>C-3PO</em>, I just didn't care for the originals that much.
      <em>Han Solo</em> is my favorite <em>Harrison Ford</em> character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the original trilogy, the first movie is a bit middle of the
      road, the second movie is kind of meh, and the third movie is in a weird
      place where it's simultaneously the best for the themes it has, the
      funniest of the three, and the worst for all the weird stuff with the
      excessive use of <em>Ewoks</em> in it. I might have enjoyed
      <em>A New Hope</em> more if it was a one-and-done experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to the prequels… I liked them, sort of. They are dumb and
      unnecessary in the grand scheme of things, like the two sequels to
      <em>A New Hope</em>, but I liked parts of them more than the original
      trilogy. All the action scenes were much better done,
      <a
        class="link-highlight"

        target="_blank"
        >the music</a
      >
      was infinitely better, and unlike
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D0ZQPqeJkk"
        target="_blank"
        >the main theme of the originals</a
      >, none of the new tracks in the prequels got on my nerves. This might be
      more of a me issue, but there are a lot of good movie themes that get
      overused within the movie they are in, and it just starts to become
      grating to me.
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9EZGHcu3E8"
        target="_blank"
        >The Good, The Bad and The Ugly theme</a
      >
      itself is pretty good, for example, but it gets overused in the movie, and
      by the final confrontation, I am just done with it. I feel the same about
      the original trilogy's main theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back to the prequels, all three of them have really good
      choreography, with <em>Revenge of the Sith's</em> simultaneous duels
      between
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw7Xxi-TxkQ"

        target="_blank"
        >Obi-Wan and Anakin</a
      >
      being my favorites. The biggest problem of the prequels, in my opinion, is
      that they are prequels and have to make the events happen in a way where
      it doesn't retcon the originals. <em>Anakin</em>
      <strong>has to live</strong> even though
      <em>Obi-Wan</em>
      <strong>would have mercy-killed him</strong> if the movie didn't demand
      that he live. Both trilogies are houses of contrivances, but the prequels'
      house is stacked much higher.

      If I had to rate the movies in comparison to one another, I’d say

        target="_blank"
        >Attack of the Clones</a
      >. I was surprised by how many people like
      <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, as even though it is the movie where
      <em>Darth Vader’s</em> relation to <em>Luke</em> is revealed, most people
      were probably spoiled on that revelation long before watching the movie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't understand the <em>Jar-Jar</em> hate, since the originals have
      just as annoying characters, like <em>R2-D2</em> and <em>Chewbacca</em>.
      Overall, <em>Star Wars</em> is not for me, meaning it's just not very
      good. One last complaint: the movies are too long. No, I shan't elaborate
      on that.

      >
      is probably the least funny <em>Mel Brooks</em> movie I've seen. In his
      other movies, the humor comes from actual jokes, while
      <em>Spaceballs</em> is a wink-wink, nudge-nudge type comedy. My lack of
      enjoyment might have to do with me not liking the thing it parodies as
      well.

      I went on a bit of a <em>Robin Williams</em> spree here. I rewatched some
      of his movies I'd already seen, discovered a few I hadn't seen before, and
      revisited others I had seen a very long time ago and had forgotten. I'll
      focus on the latter two.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/mrs-doubtfire/"
        target="_blank"
        >Mrs. Doubtfire</a
      >, and it's a pretty funny movie. My only issue with it is
      <em>Miranda</em> being worse than a combination of <em>Hitler</em>,
      <em>Lenin</em>, <em>Mao</em>, <em>Stalin</em>, <em>Pol Pot</em>, and
      <em>Leopold II</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had seen
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/jumanji/"
        target="_blank"
        >Jumanji</a
      >
      and
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/zathura-a-space-adventure/"
        target="_blank"
        >Zathura: A Space Adventure</a
      >
      as a kid on DVD, but I had long forgotten about both. I rewatched
      <em>Jumanji</em> but not <em>Zathura</em>, and I liked <em>Jumanji</em>.
      It has some very well-written parts, like <em>Alan</em> realizing he has
      become very similar to his father even though he spent the last 26 years
      in a jungle, and eventually reconciling with him when the game ends. I
      disliked having the realization scene undercut with a joke, but what can
      you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, I watched
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/what-dreams-may-come/"
        target="_blank"
        >What Dreams May Come</a
      >, and truthfully, I didn't really like it. I teared up at certain parts,
      but a lot of ideas were a miss for me. One of the bigger ones being
      <em>Marie</em> continuing to use the Asian lady's body. The scene works
      fine, but I believe God made us with a mind and a body. The outer shell
      may be just appearances, but I wouldn't want to change it to be any
      better, worse, or different than I am. Just like my mind and soul are
      essential parts of what make me who I am, my body is the temple in which
      these spiritual parts of me reside. I understand they use their proper
      bodies at the end of the movie, but using the same trick three times also
      kills the emotional impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another complaint I have is that the movie is sort of ugly. I understand
      the oil painting motif, but it looks worse in motion. The aesthetic
      elements get better as the movie goes on, but not that much better. I
      picked up on two things. First, the story reminded me of
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus_and_Eurydice"
        target="_blank"
        >Orpheus and Eurydice</a
      >, and I kept comparing the two throughout the movie. You just can't beat
      a Greek tragedy that has stood the test of time. The other is the
      <em>three</em>
      motif that appears a lot in the movie, like the
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights"
        target="_blank"
        >Garden of Earthly Delights</a
      >
      style painting with three parts to it. Although I think the first one is
      definitely a thought-out and direct nod, I can't be sure about the second
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing connecting these three movies together is kids being a driving
      force behind a lot of the story, and I have a soft spot for kids, so I
      liked that. This last one is less of a
      <em>Robin Williams</em> movie and more of a movie that
      <em>Robin Williams</em> appears in, but it felt appropriate to mention it
      in this section. Well, just like what I said about the last three movies,
      this movie also has a kid as a driving force behind a lot of the story.
      It's
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/night-at-the-museum/"
        target="_blank"
        >Night at the Museum</a
      >. I had seen it before but had forgotten all about it. It ain't great,
      but it's not terrible either. I didn't like Ricky Gervais, but the rest of
      the cast did their jobs properly. The
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/zoolander/"
        target="_blank"
        >Zoolander</a
      >
      duo is back together and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a nitpick, but after the second night, I presumed the museum
      director would have more of a problem with one of the cavemen being gone
      rather than the remaining ones being covered in foam. I am not sure if
      this is the case, but this movie felt like a direct-to-DVD or TV type of
      thing.

      Segueing into talking about <em>The Irishman</em>, I kinda didn't wanna
      see these geriatrics on my screen, especially de-aged. Many humorous
      moments stemmed from them being way too old to act like younger men.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this movie isn't as bad as <em>Goodfellas</em>, but that's more
      due to how, instead of a live fast, die young type of story, it's a story
      about worthless men whose power was only good for hurting those who lived
      more honest and fulfilling lives than them, only for them to end up with
      broken families, not being visited by anyone except the FBI, and having
      almost no remorse even at the end of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can enjoy characters who were written to be bad, but in all the cases
      where I have, they were either very charismatic or had, albeit not
      justifiable, an understandable reason for their villainous acts.

      with yakuza as one of the subplots, and I didn't really like that portion

      samurai, just like many Japanese things, are cringe. A black guy larping
      as a samurai doesn't make it any better.

      make. I don't know whether it was revolutionary when it came out, nor do I
      care, as it was a bore for me.

      was alright, but nothing special. A friend told me it was actually scary,
      but I guess he must have seen it as a young teenager or a kid.

        >A Nightmare on Elm Street</a
      >
      was amazing. It could've been one of my top 3 horror movies of all time if
      not for that awful ending. I had to watch this one while hearing my dad
      complain about the type of movies I watch, and due to having to explain
      what I liked so much about it, I really put effort into thinking about
      what makes it special. Aside from all the obvious stuff, I guess I have a
      soft spot for teenagers not getting taken seriously when they are right.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started watching
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/scream/"
        target="_blank"
        >Scream</a
      >, but 15 minutes into the movie the subtitle sync got messed up, so I
      switched to
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/film/friday-the-13th/"
        target="_blank"
        >Friday the 13th</a
      >. Funnily enough, during the first 15 minutes of <em>Scream</em>,
      <em>Friday the 13th's</em> ending was spoiled for me. I didn't really like
      <em>Friday the 13th</em>. I don't care for slasher movies that much in
      general, but this one was especially boring.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then went back to watch <em>Scream</em> with a different subtitle track,
      which ended up still being broken, but I did finish the movie. I can't say
      I enjoyed it, however. Too predictable for my tastes, along with being too
      referential. I'm not a horror movie guy, so I'm not intimately familiar
      with the rules, cliches, and the tropes of the genre, but I figured out
      quite a bit of the ending early on. I think it was around
      <em>Tatum's</em> death I guessed the existence of multiple killers, and
      guessed that <em>Billy</em> was one of the killers when it became evident
      he had watched many horror movies and could have been at the scene of
      every crime.

    <p>
      Last but not least, although this isn't a movie, it felt appropriate to
      talk about it here. A couple of months back, I watched the first two
      seasons of
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.serializd.com/show/Smiling-Friends-126506"
        target="_blank"
        >Smiling Friends</a
      >
      in one sitting and enjoyed them quite a bit. Then season 3 started to come
      out and I started watching new episodes of the show as they were coming
      out, and I also enjoyed them quite a bit. I felt as if this season had
      episodes that were funnier than those of previous seasons, while also
      having a couple of stinkers. High highs, low lows type of thing. I have
      seen all eight episodes, but <em>Sonarr</em> shows two more episodes
      having been produced. I don't know much about that, but yeah,
      <em>Smiling Friends</em> was decently funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many other movies I watched but omitted from the blogpost, since
      most of them either didn't leave much of an impression on me or weren't my
      cup of tea to begin with. There are also a couple of movies that I
      omitted, even though I liked them a lot, because if I were to talk about
      them, I would need a whole new blogpost.

    <h3>Manga</h3>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Intermission_movies_manga_and_me/Real mo Tama ni wa Uso wo Tsuku.png"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Real mo Tama ni wa Uso o Tsuku</strong> is a very short manga.
      Each chapter is 2 to 6 pages long. You can read it in its entirety in a
      couple of hours. I had been reading it for a couple of years and had
      gotten quite bored of it. Although the chapters themselves are very short,
      the wait between them and their scanlation is not. I had actually stopped
      keeping up with it for a couple of months and only learned of its ending
      from an acquaintance's post on a media thread. Needless to say, I read the
      rest of the chapters in about 15 minutes and felt the ending was rushed,
      especially compared to the arc that preceded it, which felt dragged out to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2.5 Jigen no Yuuwaku</strong> is a manga I started because it had
      cute girls in cosplay. It was an ecchi manga where softcore nudity was
      present. I didn't take it seriously for a long time because it wasn't very
      serious. I didn't really care for the character of <em>Lilysa</em> because
      she didn't have many problems. The majority of the story went ahead with
      her having no arc of her own until the last quarter of the story, where
      her arc ended up being a misunderstanding of sorts. I disliked that a lot.
      She was also a big Mary Sue. Everyone quickly became friends with her,
      even supposed rivals came to like her a lot, to the point of fighting for
      her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought the male main character, <em>Okumura</em>, wasn't much better.
      He was like a worse version of <em>Keima</em> from
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/7519/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai"
        target="_blank"
        >TWGOK</a
      >. In a way, everything in this manga could be summarized as an inferior
      version of <em>TWGOK</em>. However, it has its saving graces. In regards
      to <em>TWGOK</em>, it had been pretty obvious for a long time that he
      would end up with a girl because he had moved past his baggage. The same
      wasn't true for <em>Okumura</em>. There had been bits and pieces of him
      finally loving 3D, but loving 3D and loving a person are worlds apart.
      There were definitely hints as to who he liked too, but I would still
      argue it wasn't very concrete. Although I have spoken rather negatively
      about this manga, I did like it, and at the end, the first thought that
      came to my mind was that this was <em>Evangelion 4.0</em>, done much
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of <em>Evangelion 4.0</em>,
      <a

      ended. lol. lmao, even. Get fucked gachafags.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Kagurabachi</strong> is not very good. I read the first three or
      so chapters when that was all that existed and thought maybe I would go
      back to it later. Eventually, when it reached 100 chapters, I caught up.
      It has some dumb story moments, but my main problem is how the story
      arbitrarily puts characters out of commission for very long stretches.
      This happens to everyone, including the main character. Some characters
      who I thought would be very important to the story have not been seen in
      more than 70 chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art has also regressed a lot compared to the early chapters. Some
      background characters are basically sketches at this point. That said, I
      do not understand why people treat this as a black sheep. It is not as if
      other manga currently published in <em>Shonen Jump</em> are any better or
      worse than this. In fact, most manga published in the same magazine in the
      past had similar quality, except for the art, and the decline in art
      quality in <em>Kagurabachi</em> is fairly recent and hopefully only a
      temporary issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think a lot of people fell for the meme that it was good when it first
      started and then became jilted when it became clear that it was the same
      as many others that came before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Maria no Danzai</strong> is in the same vein as
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/126699/Shounen_no_Abyss"
        target="_blank"
        >Shounen no Abyss</a
      >, but at least that manga had some entertaining moments, while this one
      is just boring. It also flip flops about being a revenge story. The mom is
      kind of hot, and I think I even got into it because of a mom thread on
      /a/.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Intermission_movies_manga_and_me/Ookami Shounen wa Kyou mo Uso wo Kasaneru.png"
    />

    <p>
      It must have been four or five years ago. I was going through a period
      where I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. Every day felt the
      same. Now, I take that as a blessing, but back then it felt as if my life
      had ended. I can’t even pin down why I felt that way at the time. Maybe I
      could see on the horizon an end to my peaceful days with friends from
      university. Maybe it was the anxiety of entering the real world and having
      to look for a job. Maybe it was something very inconsequential.
      Regardless, I was at a turbulent point in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these days, someone asked me for a favor. They had a personal
      matter to attend to but couldn’t close their shop for a whole day. I
      didn’t really want to do it, but I didn’t have it in me to say no. So, I
      opened up early in the morning and started reading
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/85802/Ookami_Shounen_wa_Kyou_mo_Uso_wo_Kasaneru"
        target="_blank"
        >Ookami Shounen wa Kyou mo Uso wo Kasaneru</a
      >. I still had to attend to customers, so it took me the whole day to
      finish it. I remember feeling a strange mix of giddiness and sadness as I
      neared the end. I didn’t want it to conclude in a way I didn’t like.
      Thankfully, it didn’t. It ended perfectly and became my favorite romance
      manga.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Intermission_movies_manga_and_me/Cuprum no Hanayome.jpg"
    />

    <p>
      Not much has changed since then, apparently, because I had a pretty
      similar experience reading the first six volumes (that’s all the
      translated English volumes at the moment) of
      <strong>Cuprum no Hanayome</strong>. I can’t even tell how much of this is
      me genuinely loving the manga and how much of it is me just being happy to
      read another
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/people/18025/namo"
        target="_blank"
        >namo</a
      >
      work. Regardless of how much that influences my opinion,
      <em>Cuprum no Hanayome</em> is a pretty good manga. It’s lighthearted,
      cute, funny, and even bittersweet at times. The idea of your beloved
      person influencing your creative work isn’t new, but I had never seen it
      applied to this type of craft before. This one, along with
      <em>Ookami Shounen wa Kyou mo Uso wo Kasaneru</em>, comes highly
      recommended from me.
    </p>

    <h3>Closing notes</h3>
    <p>
      This is certainly the longest blogpost I’ve ever written, and I don’t
      think I’ll ever top it in terms of length. I had a lot to say about
      movies, and I wanted to get it all out of my system. I made a
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/NecRaul/"
        target="_blank"
        >Letterboxd account</a
      >
      and a
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.serializd.com/user/NecRaul/profile"
        target="_blank"
        >Serializd account</a
      >
      to go along with my
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/NecRaul"
        target="_blank"
        >MyAnimeList account</a
      >
      and spreadsheets. I have also edited
      <a class="link-highlight" href="/about/" target="_blank">my about page</a>
      to reflect these new additions to my media consumption habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of it all, I guess I have a few things to say about movies and
      TV shows. I don’t think I’ll ever watch a TV show with 40 to 45 minute
      episodes again. When I look back at the ones I finished, it feels
      exhausting. They aren’t as good as movies tend to be, but they take an
      extreme amount of time compared to almost anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the longest visual novels usually top out around 120 to 140 hours,
      but some of these TV shows go on forever. Not only do I get disinterested,
      they never manage to keep the same level of quality, and I’m talking about
      the good ones here.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I'm being honest, most of TV shows I watched were something I got
      pulled into by a former girlfriend or a girl I wanted to be my girlfriend.
      So what I'm trying to say is that TV shows feel like worse versions of
      movies made by people who aren't trusted with making actual movies. And I
      already prefer other mediums over movies to begin with.
    </p>

    <img
      class="postimage zoomimage"
      src="/images/post/Intermission_movies_manga_and_me/Sora no Woto stream.png"
    />

    <p>
      Aside from all that, I attended the yearly
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To"
        target="_blank"
        >Sora no Woto</a
      >
      rewatch stream with /a/. It had been a couple of years since I had the
      time to watch it, join any watch-alongs with /a/, hang out for post-stream
      r/a/dio, or chat with people in the r/a/dio IRC. Suffice it to say, it was
      as good as I remembered it, nay, even better, and maybe I only enjoyed it
      that much because of the whole experience, but what the hell. Due to how
      much I enjoyed it, I also updated my Anime 3x3, replacing
      <em>Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko</em> with <em>Sora no Woto</em>. The
      former is great in its own right, but there is something about
      <em>Sora no Woto</em> that I cannot quite put into words. I guess this
      will be my other recommendation: it is great, and you should give it a
      watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next post, which will be about <em>Mushoku Tensei</em>, is long
      overdue. I was planning to finish <em>Nukitashi 2</em> by the end of
      November at the latest and write the blogpost a couple of days after that,
      but things outside of my control kept happening, so I ended up working on
      this one alongside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Mushoku Tensei</em> blogpost should be shorter than this one or
      the
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="/post/Nukitashi_1+2_review/"
        target="_blank"
        >Nukitashi blogpost</a
      >. I already have most of my thoughts in order, but I might wait until
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://x.com/TheLuciusSeneca"
        target="_blank"
        >Lucius Seneca</a
      >
      finishes his translation of <em>Paul Gaiden</em> and I re-read it before I
      start writing that blogpost.
