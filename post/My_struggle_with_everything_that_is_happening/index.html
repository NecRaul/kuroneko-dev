    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      Earlier this year, I picked up a philosophy book for an exam I had to
      take. It went from what the very notion of philosophy is and how to define
      it to modern philosophical ideas and movements like post-modernism. It
      wasn't a very interesting read to me. I can't put it into words try as i
      might but I can not wrap my head around philosophy being a field of
      science. I feel the same way about other fields as well and I believe for
      one field to be labeled as science it has to have some level of
      concreteness and definiteness which philosophy definitely lacks. It's
      about ideas, how people shape them and in turn they shape people et
      cetera. I also don't give a shit about most philosophers. I had a
      conversation with my father about this topic very recently and although he
      feels the same way about science fields to a degree, he doesn't share my
      sentiment regarding philosophy. He's also more well-read than me in the
      field so one might chalk it up to that. At a certain point in our
      conversation, he asked me to explain in my own ideas something Zoroaster
      preached and I couldn't. I told him that I couldn't put myself in a frame
      of mind of someone who lived that far back. I could do the same for some
      of the Greek philosophers I had read though. With all that being said,
      nothing that I could come up with would be treated as the right answer to
      the question by anyone in this field. Somehow philosophy is both something
      concrete and not I guess. Throught the book I could atleast understand
      parts of what each movement was trying to achieve and although I didn't
      agree wholeheartedly, I could believe that people who were invested
      believed their ideas to be the solution to the problem or problems at
      hand. I can't say the same for post-modernism.
    </p>

    <h3>Post-modernism</h3>
    <p>
      Whether I like it or not, I now live in a society dominated by
      post-modernist ideas. Everything one might believe to be sacred has been
      replaced by an imitation, a mockery and a cruel and tasteless joke.
      There's not "the truth" but "one's truth". By making it as such, the
      academic and the elite class have stripped anything held dear by they see
      as "other" to its bare minimum and called it worthless. The sincerity in
      anything has been labeled as naive, immature and stupid. What Nietzsche
      spent his whole life writing and warning against has become the norm for
      not only the aforementioned academics and the elites but also for the
      average Joe. Irony has ruined the well of humanity and everything
      fundamental to the human experience has been defiled.

      My father always took care of his books. He had many of them, each with
      different conditions. Looking at it, you couldn't really tell the sort of
      person he was. I suppose you probably couldn't with many people but I
      digress. When I was very young, I would ask him to read his books to me.
      When I got a little older and started school, I would borrow books from
      the library and read them. When I went through basically everything
      available to me in that library, I asked my mom to get me books from her
      school library. When I eventually exhausted all of them, I obtained a
      library card for my city's public library. I was always fascinated by
      these larger than life characters in the books I was reading. As I grew up
      and started to grasp more complex topics and understood the nature of
      things happening around me, my childish naïveté faded a little bit. I was
      still an optimist at heart. I believe still hasn't changed. I still
      dislike cynicism for the sake of cynicism and nothing else. I hate being
      presented with an awful thought with no solution. It seems to me like
      whining of an 8 year old. I have changed a lot, but I have not lost hope.

    <h3>Strange times</h3>
    <p>
      I can't even tell to which degree the aforementioned problems of
      post-modernism and everything that stems from it are the biggest sources
      of unhappiness in my life. The very notion of fulfillment from anything
      that is not connected to humanity and the human experience seems laughable
      to me, yet I can not form human connections. I remember that speech from
      the movie "The End of the Tour" about masturbation, technology and
      pleasure. Unlike David Foster Wallace, I'm not suicidal. I am younger than
      he was when he was going through depression, alcoholism and eventually
      suicide watch. Who knows though, maybe my time just hasn't come yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess what I want to say is, I don't think human beings were supposed to
      live like this. Maybe individuals with prominent Dark Triad traits will
      live prosperously in this type of environment and others will eventually
      evolve to be like them but I'm talking about regular people. Ones with
      concrete beliefs, justifications for these beliefs rooted in something,
      maybe faith or something I can't put into words. Funny thing is, anytime
      someone mentions these things and how uncomfortable they are with the
      state of affairs that's going on, they get ridiculed for having
      rose-tinted glasses. It's that stupid soyjak meme of "the 50s were not
      like this, no one has EVER been happy". Unfortunately, we live in an era
      where the truth doesn't exist atleast not in a way that will be
      foreseeable by the future generations. Anything important gets shrugged
      under the rug. The world is dominated by "rage-bait" and it has become
      difficult to distinguish the truth from cleverly constructed rage-bait.

      Earlier this year, I had the chance of revisiting some of my favorite
      books, movies, manga and anime. I always knew this instinctively but it
      was further reaffirmed that my beliefs and ideas are reflected in my
      favorites. I thought about it for a couple of days, trying to figure out
      whether I like them because of my beliefs or whether these beliefs formed
      because something within them resonated with me. Sort of a chicken and egg
      problem. Although I still can't clearly say it's one or the other, I've
      come to the conclusion that it matters not. Everything around us shape us
      in one way or another which is worrying considering my distaste for how
      things around us are like at the moment. With these thoughts in mind, I
      worry less about myself and more about the future generations and what
      they will go through. I can only hope that cycle of "hard times -> strong
      men -> good times -> weak men -> hard times" is true.

    <h3>Ongoing events</h3>
    <p>
      It has become impossible to live outside of the system. The system itself
      however is built upon layers of corruption. Any attempt at stripping away
      these layers are faced with brutal degredation of the person or group
      attempting it. The economy is a lie, corporations with power beyond one's
      belief control the narrative, insurance companies suck people's marrow. A
      passerby assassinated the CEO of one of the health insurance companies in
      the US, in pursuit of this assassin they locked up someone who is probably
      not the assassin because failure to apprehend the "criminal" would give
      the idea that system can be torn down by ordinary people. I always thought
      the "social contract" had flaws that bad actors could take advantages of,
      seeing it happen in my lifetime so clearly has been vindicating, yet I and
      many others are powerless to change the system.

      I was not old enough for politics when Ron Paul was running for president
      of the United States. Years later his ideas are still alive and kicking.
      The only thing I hope for is those ideas to bear fruit. I don't really
      care for Donald J. Trump or Elon Musk - I prefer them to the opposition
      but that's another matter, for all I care they are the ones who have
      broken the social contract in a way where it's acceptable to most people.
      However, if one good thing that comes out of Trump presidency is Ron
      Paul's beliefs to come to fruition and make some positive change in the
      world, I'll be happy and vindicated.
