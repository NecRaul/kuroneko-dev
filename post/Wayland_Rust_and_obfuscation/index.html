    <h3>Linux</h3>
    <p>
      I first used Linux while working on projects for my bachelor's degree. I
      could've probably used a VM or maybe WSL (I don't remember if it was
      around back then) to not have to install Linux, but I had a spare 240 GB
      SSD from an old laptop, so I bit the bullet, installed
      <strong>Ubuntu</strong> on it, and tackled the coursework. However, using
      Ubuntu wasn't too great of an experience. I didn't know this at the time,
      but my issues weren't related to Linux itself; they had to do with the
      package manager. <strong>Apt-get</strong> in and of itself is fine, but
      whenever I had to download the latest version of something, it gave me
      some headache. <strong>Snaps</strong> (fuck <strong>Canonical</strong>)
      were annoying, and while I understood <strong>PPAs</strong>, I found them
      unstable on a distro marketed as stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the time <strong>Windows 11</strong> was announced, I was already
      moving away from daily gaming. I had quit Destiny 2, and most of my time
      was being spent watching anime, working, or working on my Master's degree.
      The games I was playing were mostly older games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R.,
      Thief, Deus Ex, etc. on PC, and the rest of it was JRPGs and VNs on Vita.
      I don't remember what it was that exactly made me want to switch off of
      Windows, but it wasnâ€™t just one issue - it was years of frustration
      building up. I was already managing some <strong>Debian</strong> and
      <strong>OpenBSD</strong> servers at my job, so I was more knowledgeable
      about UNIX systems than a couple years ago. I bit the bullet, looked up
      some tutorials, installed <strong>Arch Linux</strong> with
      <em>XFCE</em> on a VM as a test run, backed up my data, and finally
      installed <strong>Arch Linux</strong> with <em>KDE Plasma 5</em>. I didn't
      have the easiest installation process - I wiped one of my hard drives even
      (thank God I had backed it up) - but eventually, I had a working setup. It
      allowed me to do everything I had done in Windows without giving me a
      headache. Setting up a development environment was much easier (even
      though, for Python, I still break the rules by using global packages
      instead of using a virtual environment). All my emulators (haven't tried
      Xbox/Xbox 360 emulation yet) worked great and all the games I wanted to
      play either worked fine out of the box or did so with some tinkering. What
      I'm trying to say is, it worked great for my use case. Arch being a
      rolling release distro allowed me to use the new and shiny thing. It never
      broke anything on my system either. Only complaint I had at the time
      (which I still do) was how Linux does audio. I don't remember if I was
      using Pulseaudio or Pipewire, but I switched from one to the other, and it
      had all the same issues. Not being able to share my audio while screen
      sharing in Discord was another issue I had, but that's also audio related.
      At the time, this was an issue on both <strong>X11</strong> and
      <strong>Wayland</strong>. As of now, I can share audio on Discord in X11
      (in some applications - I still need to do more testing to confirm).
    </p>
    <p>
      My honeymoon with Linux, more specifically KDE Plasma 5, ended when
      <em>KDE Plasma 6</em> came out. It replaced KDE Plasma 5 on my machine,
      and it was utterly broken. I think it also changed my default session from
      X11 to Wayland, and that certainly didn't help either. Regardless, a lot
      of things being broken or different soured my view on Plasma 6. I was
      already toying with the idea of using a
      <strong>window manager</strong> instead of a
      <strong>desktop environment</strong> at the time, so I started looking
      around and decided on <strong><em>dwm</em></strong
      >. I installed it on a work laptop because I wasn't ready to go all-in
      yet. I had some struggles, but eventually, I managed to smooth them over.
      Soon after, I backed up my data again, did a fresh Arch install, and
      started using dwm. It's been a little over a year and a half now, and I'm
      still using dwm. I use <em>KDE Dolphin</em> for a GUI file manager because
      it's pretty damn good, but otherwise, I can't think of any KDE apps I
      have. Eventually, I wanted to try <strong>Fedora</strong> to familiarize
      myself with the whole <strong>Red Hat</strong> environment, but
      <em>GNOME</em> felt weird to me. I had some complaints similar to my
      complaints regarding Ubuntu, and Fedora felt like
      <em>beta-testing a future RHEL system</em> to me. So I formatted that
      drive and installed Windows on it. Basically, I've been using Linux for
      only two years, and I'm not an expert or an authority at it. With all that
      being said, we can move onto Wayland, Rust, and what I think is happening
      in the open source environment.

    <h3>Wayland</h3>
    <p>
      As I mentioned earlier, I've had very little experience with Wayland, but
      what little experience I did have wasn't positive. Even before I saw the
      general Wayland backlash on /g/ and elsewhere, I was running into issues
      with software compatibility. Most of them were small things. I remember
      having to change my mpv configs a lot to get them to work the way I
      wanted. Another was screen sharing/recording in different applications
      (Discord, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, OBS, ffmpeg, etc.). I couldn't figure out
      image previews on lf and other terminal file managers. I had somehow
      managed to make it work using stpv/ctpv and chafa, but it was very
      pixelated and blurry. There were more issues I ran into, but I digress.
      Eventually, I asked a friend (an oldfag from /g/) to help. He checked and
      saw I was on Plasma 5 under Wayland - then told me to switch to X11. I
      should be clear that this happened very early on, when I had first started
      using Linux, so I probably only experienced a tiny percentage of the
      issues others would experience. I don't know how good Wayland is now, and
      because dwm is X11 only, I'm not planning on finding out how much Wayland
      has improved. Maybe when I get a new laptop, I'll make an attempt to learn
      a new distro like Nix or something. Then I'll put dwl or Hyprland on it
      and see how much it has improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that being said, since I'm not on Wayland and I don't develop or
      maintain software in the Wayland, my point of reference is other people -
      two in particular. One of them is

      and

      blogpost from Dudemanguy, Wayland has improved quite a lot over the last
      couple of years. This is probably good for Wayland itself, the userspace,
      and maybe the devs. I say maybe because I am not sure how good it is for
      developers building stuff in Wayland, because I think there's a major
      design flaw in Wayland, due to how small it is and how everyone seems to
      be doing their own thing. None of that means much for me. I am a person
      who doesn't really want my experience to change. I don't think Wayland is
      <em>better</em> but <em>different</em>. I don't want to find something new
      to learn, especially if it's not gonna make me money or meaningfully
      change my experience for the better. Wayland was undercooked last time I
      was forced to use it (KDE Plasma 6/GNOME), and I suspect it still is. The
      <a
        class="link-highlight"

        target="_blank"
        >anti-Wayland Gist</a
      >
      from probonopd still shows a lot of features that are either missing or
      incompatible with what I use daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other thing I really dislike is how much it is being pushed. Red Hat
      said they would drop support for X11 back in 2023, and they seem to be
      doing exactly that. I had my concerns back when I read about it, and now
      they seems to be getting realized. It's not just Red Hat dropping support,
      but other major things in the corporate Linux environment (even more so in
      enterprise settings). They also seem to not really care for BSD all that
      much, which is sad because I liked maintaining the BSD servers at my
      previous job more than any other - that is to say, BSD didn't really need
      any maintenance. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I don't think giving
      control of Linux/BSD to major for-profit companies seems like a good idea.

      model comes to mind. Nvidia might be a money-hungry company that won't
      make their drivers open source, but they are a hardware company first and
      foremost. I'm happy whenever they do something good and don't really care
      when they jack up their prices or do something bad, since I am not their
      customer. From what I understand, Wayland also performs significantly
      worse with Nvidia (with both proprietary and open source drivers). While
      you might call Nvidia bad, Red Hat and Canonical are spawn of Satan
      compared to Nvidia in my opinion. It's not bad enough that Red Hat is
      pushing Wayland this hard - they are actively sabotaging development of
      X11. Thankfully, there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel with

      and I'm excited to see where it leads.
    </p>

    <img class="postimage" src="/images/posts/Rust ugly.png" />

    <h3>Rust</h3>
    <p>
      Similar to Wayland, I have no experience developing in
      <strong>Rust</strong>. I can understand why some people like the language
      but I don't understand why they would choose to develop in a language that
      ugly. It has somewhat shaped newer versions of C++ to be just as ugly as
      itself which I'm not too happy about. Unlike many people, I don't have a
      problem with Rust itself (aside from it being ugly). I dislike the cult
      surrounding Rust, but at the end of the day I value good software more
      than I disdain the community. The problem with good software in this case
      is, the small changes in behavior make dropping them as a replacement
      either hard or straight up impossible. I am happy using
      <strong>paru</strong>, which is written in Rust. I like
      <strong>bat</strong>, <strong>eza</strong>, <strong>zoxide</strong>,
      <strong>rg</strong>, and <strong>fd</strong>. The issue is, the small
      differences in behavior, syntax, etc. are so annoying. fd is the biggest
      offender - I rely on <em>find</em> so much that many of my scripts break
      without it (or when I replace it with fd). Although I've heard people
      complain about rg, my use case for grep tends to be for simple things
      unlike find, so I can just replace it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another issue with these Rust rewrites of coreutils (and some other
      applications) seems to be license-related. Now, I am not too big on any
      license. I have used <em>GPL v2.0</em>, <em>GPL v3.0</em>,
      <em>LGPL v2.1</em> (my favorite of the bunch, since the stuff I'm
      currently most proud of are Python/Pip packages), <em>BSD 3-Clause</em>,
      <em>MIT</em>, and even <em>Unlicense</em> on my personal projects.
      However, these Rust devs take GPL v2.0 and v3.0 projects and rewrite them
      with permissive licenses, and I believe that is bad for the open source
      environment. I'm gonna refer back to my hate on Canonical, since now they
      are rewriting sudo to Rust with a permissive license.
    </p>

    <h3>Closing notes</h3>
    <p>
      All in all, refering back to what I said early on, Iâ€™m not an X11/Wayland
      developer - just an end user. My opinion should be treated accordingly. I
      really hope XLibre turns out to be as good as it seems and improves and
      maintains the existing software without breaking anything in my setup.
      Regarding Rust, time will tell. Early last year,

      corporations meddling in open source development, I donâ€™t want the
      government doing the same either.
