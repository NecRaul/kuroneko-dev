      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      I like the usual otaku stuff
      <em>(anime, manga, light novels, visual novels, etc.)</em>, and I also
      code from time to time. All my money goes to buying physical Japanese
      media. My preferred programming languages are <em>C, C#, and Python</em>,
      but I dabble in others too. I have a <em>Bachelor's Degree</em> and a
      <em>Master's Degree</em> in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, and I am
      planning on getting a <em>Doctorate</em> in the near future. I also happen
      to have a slight disdain for people who do not share my ideas, as my ideas
      are undoubtedly the best ones there are.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this site, I will share my insane
      <em
        >(I personally believe they are totally normal, but people tend to
        disagree with me)</em
      >
      beliefs, media I have consumed and that left an impact on me
      <em>(good or bad)</em>, things I am excited or disappointed about, etc.
      Basically, whenever I want to blogpost on a
      <strong>Taiwanese basket weaving forum</strong>, I will refrain from doing
      so and do it here instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/@necraul"
        target="_blank"
        >my YouTube channel</a
      >. I share gameplay videos from various games I am playing every once in a
      while. If I have shared a video from a game, I probably have a high
      opinion of that game.
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://gist.github.com/NecRaul/e0e750bb481fccbae5fd948d05ce154d"
        target="_blank"
        >My backlog</a
      >
      of vidya <em>(along other things)</em> is pretty long, so despite the fact
      that games <em>(along other things)</em> coming out nowadays are a
      disappointment more often than not, I will continue to eat good for a
      little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/NecRaul"
        target="_blank"
        >my MyAnimeList account</a
      >. I do not particularly care which of the anime tracking platforms is the
      best. I had a MyAnimeList account a long time ago, but then I got banned,
      switched to using spreadsheets (which I still do), and later made a
      MyAnimeList account to link to people who happen to be curious about what
      I watch. I do not rate anything on there. I have noted my thoughts about
      every anime I have watched on my personal spreadsheet, but I do not share
      that with just anyone. If you ask my opinion of an anime, I will happily
      share it with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, I have
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://letterboxd.com/NecRaul/"
        target="_blank"
        >a Letterboxd account</a
      >,
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://www.serializd.com/user/NecRaul/profile"
        target="_blank"
        >a Serializd account</a
      >, and
      <a
        class="link-highlight"
        href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~NecRaul"
        target="_blank"
        >a RateYourMusic account</a
      >. The former two I update whenever necessary, meaning when I watch a new
      movie or a TV show that is not an anime. The latter is empty at the
      moment, because I have listened to a lot of music throughout my life and
      the thought of logging and rating all of it is too daunting a task for me
      to undertake. I made the RateYourMusic account on a whim because the
      website did not allow me to see explicit album covers, and I never
      intended to use it for logging anything. Who is to say I will not change
      my mind one day, but for the foreseeable future, I will not use that
      account for its intended purpose.

      may also reach out to me through the other accounts I have linked here,
